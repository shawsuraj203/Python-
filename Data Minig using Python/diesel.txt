Full Review 
 
This is my first car and I have just learnt car driving, I feel very comfortable in driving this car, got confident within one day after owning this car. Its too smooth to drive. I had bought this car for 5,42,500 with Basic Accessories, temp number and insurance. Since VX version of this car was not launced by 24th August, 2011, LX was the top variant by that time, so I missed VX vesion.
Pros:
1. Mileage - I got mileage of 15 kmpl with first 1000 kms ( 10 days) out of which 200 kms I covered with 1st or 2nd gear while learning. The maximum speed I touched was 90 kmpl on NH10 while going to Sirsa from delhi. I feel mileage will increase when I will be more experienced in driving.
2. Spacious: Car is spacious enough for your comfort.
Problems:
1. AC Belt is creating a lot of sound (Chrrrr..) if you switch on the AC within 2 minutes of starting the Car, even after 1st service it was not fully corrected (sound is reduced to some level) by the  Automobile Sterling, Noida.
2. The side strips on door are easily removable, the strip locks were loose at the time of delivery and I had asked the SalesPerson to get is corrected, they just affixed the same using elfy, after 2-3 days the strips again got detached from the doors.
Service from Automobile Sterling, Noida:
I had sent the Car for First free Service, they didnt charge me anything but after delivery of the vehicle to my office, I found following thing which they didnt correct:
1. they used some black material to affix the strips, instead of repairing the locks they are doing some "JUGAAD", which means it will be in same state after some time.
2. The AC Fan Belt is still noisy (Noise reduced to some level), We dont expect such sound from a New Car.
3. The vehicle was not cleaned properly, even I had told the points of dirt to the driver, still these were not cleaned.

I got this car on 26th June, 2011. I have used it for close to 2.5 months and have done upto 3500 kms.
Exterior Exterior of the vehicle gives a royal look and it would definately turn heads. Very Neat Design, Blinking indicators on ORVMs adds the glamour to the royal sedan. Smooth Finish on the Exterior is what makes a person go for this car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) For its price, its absolute VFM. Interiors are good expecially reading lamps for all four seats, internally adjustable ORVMs, Anti glare IVRM and it is also a very spacious car with lot of head room & legroom. Boot Space is surprisingly big enough even though it appears small from outside.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine Performance is good as the new engine does a good job. But CR4 makes more noise compared to TDI. Fuel Economy promised by ARAI is 23 but does not give more than 17 on highway + City conditions. On high way it may touch 20.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is decent but handling is tough especially when compared to swift dzire. The power steering is hard and make manuverability difficult. The lever on the foot are so high that it is difficult to drive for long distances. Fittings are not done properly and the music system is of budget quality. Don't be surprised if things start falling apart after few months.
Final Words Absolute VFM sedan for starters. As usual TATA Fit & Finish & Service is living upto its reputation. I have a severe post purchase dissonnace & could have gone for swift dzire but because of floods in Japan Deliveries were not happening.
Areas of improvement Good quality Parts, better fit & finish, Tata engineers should take longer test drives for driver comfort and engine noise can be substantially reduced.

Its a very good sedan , i bought it as new and till the date it covered nearly 2000 - its giving and average of 24 in city with full ac, and above 26 in high way  , one problem i faced  is the engine goes  off condition when gear goes from 4th  to 3 rd  but it occured  only   2 times  so tata service personnel cant find the fault , compared to swift its interior is a bit  bad ( even to vista( its shows tata can make good interior quality) ), accelaration is little low compared to vista and swift   but efficiency is high( swift -18 avg and vista -19 ) if  you are looking for low maintenance cost and fuel efficiency and resale value go for it  - if you fun loving and want to cruise in high ways go for vista - if you need good handling  good acceleration compared to indigo( not to vista)  go for swift.

Final Words Over all it is not so good
Areas of improvement It need vey improvement in it, its good but not the best, as the name of company TATA people beleave and purchase it  snd the company should provide them more facilities, I was not thinking that this company will launch this type of car. so bad.
Waht we can say is it is good but the car is not giving that much average in which people would purchase it, So I hope from the company that you will se my message and try to improve the average make your company once again the top copmpanies in cars also.
With lots of hope I purchase that car but witthin a year I sold it. Next problem is the safety problem. It does no have air bags etc. Many baD features aur there so you may improve it,  feeling so bad to have this dustbin taxi car so bad.

Exterior Definately its head turner on signals, Double colour  head light, Both side Power mirrors with blinkers gives eye catching  effect.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Since beginning its  awesome seat comfort with great leg space. (just can't compare with  maruti & hyundai where you cant come out without pushing back the  front seats. And about rare seats are they fits you inside? ) Interiors  are jusk OK not much attractive but its your budget car yaar!!! Power  windows, power mirrors, Head light adjustments and defogger gives great  impression.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good refined engine with too good fuel economy 20 kmpl with a/c in city!!!
Ride Quality & Handling Riding this car is a pleasure with Auto gradient feature of engine but need to improve more on handling quality.
Final Words VFM CAR.
Areas of improvement Should introduce ZX Version with proper duel tone dashboad, 2 din music system, Airbags & rare a/c vents.

Exterior -- looks good.  The Front Grill design also.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Nice look, good boot space... feel very much comfort inside.  
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox  Good  pickup..... I got this on 5-feb-2012... I have gone for round trip  (Mumbai - shirdi -- shani shinganapur-pune-mumbai).    No problem with AC on. Milage which I got ---- is around 25 KMPM.   Till today I have completed 1700 Km.   I live in powai...  There I usually get 17 KMPL (i.e. within CITY)
 
Ride Quality & Handling Superb handling. I like the smoothness of stering. good control over the car.  I had learned 4-wheeler some 13 years ago  that too from my Uncle (not from any driving school) for 2-3 times only.    But I got used to this Car within a Week.    
 
Final Words Good for middle calss. Good for new users of car.  
 
Areas of improvement  ---  1) The Bottle holder should be near Hand Break.  2) Place A Tata Metal logo Emblem  on front Hood Bonnet to give this Car a Royal Look.

Exterior
 Moderate looks; agian you can see 80% of Indica Looks ( most my friends asked me that, when did you purchased Indica by looking the car from front)
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Car features moderate & it is not comfort at all for long drives
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Low Pick-up...........
jerking of vehicle at low speeds even in low RPM which demands frequent shifting of gears
Ride Quality & Handling
Not impressive when compared with even M800. I have to apply clutch or shift 1st gear at speed brakers and while driving in busy roads
Final Words
 I had puchased Indigo CS Dicor LX model and realized after 3 months that, I would have choosen some other make by spending 1 or 2 Lacs more.
Areas of improvement  
 Leg room is conjusted,....\\\\\
Drving is not comfortable,..........
Lazy Engine Pick-up( weekest engine when compared to any other sedan class cars), Power steering to be made smooth, Cabin air tightness ....

Full Review 
Exterior The car looks very good from outside. ORVM are exelent when blinks on signals.  You don't believe that on middle of drive, many times people asked the price of my car and appriciated it.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiers are of ok quality. Plasics are fine but it gets scratches even in single harsh push. The scratches are seen in sunny day light specially in noon time. Power windows are better and having windows lock on middle front side under dash board. Steering is well built and easy to handle. 2 Cup Holders are in front dash board inside.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is bert in its class. Car takes 0-100 only in 12 secs with no extra load on engine. Car can touch 120-130 easily with 3,500 rpm(max is 6,000 rpm in this car) The car gives milage in city 17.5 and on highway, it gives 21-23 kmpl. Gear box is good and gear shift is very smooth. few vibration is felt on gear shift.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is very good. driving 200 kms is not tiring. It gives pleasure with no noise when car reaches above 100km/h.
Final Words I just like it as with better fuel average and more power in its segment(appox.5 lacs in sedan class).
Areas of improvement Interier plastics should be better quality, shockers improvement should be there. Dash Board is same as old Indica.

Full Review 
Exterior No problem at all, since my car is parked in the open with rains and sun beating on it, Kerala weather.  But everytime I wash it, it looks like new. Good paint job.  Panel gaps is a big, but so far water from rain has not gone inside the car or dicky.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) I brought the VX Full option in Nov 2011, Very comfortable, it is because I have the full option version, the seats are fabric and good. I use the car for very long distances, some times driving 3500-4000 km at a stretch Kerala to Mumbai, Nasik. I sleep in the car at nights in the back, very comfortable. The plastics could be better though. But then when I pay Rs. 6.04 laks for this full option, I dont mind. Because other company cars with all the features which I have in my car will cost me more than 8 laks.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is top notch. No complaints whatsoever.  Now after almost 22 months it gives 18-19 with AC on all the time. Gear box is a problem sometimes, shift is not smooth. I think in the new one introduced in 2013 they have improved.  So far problem I faced is with alternator, it went out of service after 16 months. I think it is because I am continously using it, daily at least I start and stop 10-12 times.  It cost me 12,000. If I had taken extended warranty, I would have saved that money as it was free replacement. But I had not taken extended warranty. I recommend anyone buying any car to please take extended warranty. I made a mistake by saving 3000 on extended warranty and ended up paying 12,000. The silencer is becoming loose, I have to check it. Otherwise no problems.  In 22 months I have driven about 34,000 km. So value for money.
Ride Quality & Handling Smooth, I drive most of the times on very bad roads, but it handles it well.  My friend has Toyota Etios also, and he also drives as much as I do, but he has faced more problems. So my conclusion is my Indigo is better. Etios is good for smooth roads not for bad.  Service is excellent in Thrissur, Kerala. No complaints at all. By the way service for all model cars in Kerala they have very good service. So everyone is equal there.
Final Words Really value for money.
Areas of improvement Panel gaps, they look awful. And plastic. But I know Tata will not improve, they are like government.

Exterior
 i have purchased new indigo ecs-vx model.it is top version.i like its exterior so much.dual tone bumpers(front & rear) are so attractive and lot of strength in them.chromed fog lights are very dashing.tata logo also looking gud in front bumper.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 music system is very good.very comfortable seats.gud brakes.in this version abs feature is also available.dashboard is also looking well.slightly lack of finish.major issue of missing ash tray,cup holders.overall interior is nice.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 this is my first diesel car.before indigo i was using alto-lx.so their is less pick up then petrol car.tata is saying that they improved the nvh of car but i think it is same as in old cars.we have already 2 indicas(commercial purpose) & i compared indigo ecs with them.i found same nvh but i have no problem because at the time of driving i like loud music.
Ride Quality & Handling
i am addict of maruti.as compared to my old car i feel slightly unconvient to drive this.when i drive i feel that my hands are in air and they feel not comfortable as in alto. this time i have run only 250kms.so i give review on this after sometime(ride quality & handling).
Final Words
 i am very happy because in this amount you only go for diesel-hatch back,not for sedan.secondaly no problem of finance because tata finance is available.finally it is a superb sedan.good value for money.
Areas of improvement  
 arm rest in door for driver side,dashboard finish,ash tray,cup holders,low quality mud flaps,power window switch not available in front doors.i am getting 16km/ltr.in 250 kms.waiting for my first service.then i check whats the average is coming.

Full Review 
Exterior good. has a executive look.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) comfortable. dash board looks outdated.mobile charger socket fitted by company does not allow any standard charger to fit in and had to be replaced in a NEW CAR.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I have driven the vehicle for 40,000km in 9 months in personal use BETWEEN HOME TO OFFICE. Requires repeated alignment every 2000km and if you fail to get it checked, BE PREPARED TO REPLACE ALL 4 TYRES BEFORE YOU GO FOR NEXT SERVICING AT EVERY 10,000 KM. I HAD TO  REPLACE MY TYRES AT 20,000KM AND AGAIN NOW IT IS REQUIRED AT 39,000KM. A MAINTAINANCE COST, NO ONE WOULD BE WILLING TO BEAR.
FUEL ECONOMY IS FAIR. mAX, 20 KM/L ON 4 LANE WITH MAX. DRIVING AT CONSTANT SPEED BETWEEN 60 TO 80KM/HR.
stereo does not match the expected quality in terms of sound quality.
vehicle is noisy and dust enters from unknown destinations inside the car. The car is always driven with windows in closed condition with A/C or heater.
Similar problem of dust entering the car was seen with Tata Sumo which I have used earlier for more than 1 lakh KM.
No such problems have been experienced(alignment, noisy, dust, stereo) with Maruti wagon R which I have used for more thar 1,30,000km. or Ford fiesta that I have used for 35000 km.
Ride Quality & Handling Fair, feel tired on long driving of 300 -400 km which was not the case with Wagon R (Maruti) or Ford fiesta.
Final Words I would Not reccomend this vehile for puchase. My Mobile NO. 945167XXXX.
Areas of improvement Lo5t of noises and technically poor quality. company needs to rethink about this vehicle.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Dashboard lowest quality,(DIDNT PROVIE SEAT COVER N POWER WINDOW CONTROL TO DRIVERS WINDOW EVEN IN TOP MODEL),plastic other than dashboard is also of very poor quality.ac is faulty(they promissed me wil repair in next service)but that vanishd all my joy of buying new vihicle.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good,got16.5 with ac on,GEAR SHIFTING NOT SMOOTH (MAY BE AS SHE IS NEW) quite vibrating.
Ride Quality & Handling LEVER PADDLE HIGH PAINFUL FOR BEGINERS.do not feel they bave provided abs while handling.

Areas of improvement Tata service at ground level is poor,check that u r gettin car with min running.in the name of transport they provide me car with 850km runed car.didnt got satisfactory ans even from tata service desk.should provide stephani of alloy wheels.

Exterior
 Exterior looks compact and has good designing.The new eCs version looks better than the previous versions. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Interiors are basic and not upto the mark. Much better quality is required in the insides of the car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Gearbox is a troubling aspect of this car. Not very smooth at times. Engine does good and fuel economy of the car is decent. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is very smooth and it's easy to manuver the car in tight spaces. Ease of drive suits the daily requirements. 
Final Words
 A good car to own for people who don't have a budget of more than 7.5 lakhs. Much better seating and sturdy car for driving in the city. Good on mileage and easy to maintain. The diesel version gives good average and most of the aspects of this car are correct and for Indian users. 
Areas of improvement  
 The car's interiors lack attractive finish and needs a lot of refinement. The gearbox needs refinement too as it becomes little uneasy at times. More attractive colors and automated controls would do wonders with time.

Exterior
 is good but it should be change from front. its tough to identify between indica and indigo should have sporty look
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 its pathetic comparing to Swift never gave me feel and comfort of Sedan  although space is good enough but it makes you feel sitting in some old fashion car don't know what kind of plastic they use interiors are too bad
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 though engine is good but noicy as all tata cars but average and low maintenance are only valid point to buy this car i had indigo for almost 4 years and average was always between 18-22 in delhi's traffic and on highway i guess its 24KMPL so FE is Awesome now come to Gearbox again one more pathetic thing in car whenever you shift gear it makes you feel driving tractor in comparison to swift and ritz.
Ride Quality & Handling
 its not joyful its OK OK type of feel niether hard nor smooth. 
Final Words
 Main setback is resale value no one wants to buy tata car accept cab drivers and car is good for taxi owners not for common people 
Areas of improvement  
 From looks to engineering (interior,Gearbox,Vibration,Sound, Front look)

Exterior Nice.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Just the interiors are not upto mark, lot of space including boot, very comfortable. A nice car to own.just Tata needs to market it well and improve interiors.Tata needs to make more aggressive marketing as this car is worth the money we pay.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Enginee performanace is good, Not much sound of engine while driving, smooth gear shifting, like butter.
Ride Quality & Handling Worth a buy at the price , it is definetely a good car but as usual we are ready to spend more than 1.6 lac on  other cars like maruti, hoonda and huyndai with similar or less specifications. just a mental block with indians. tata has really done good. just need to improve interiors.
Final Words Nice car at this price. really it is nice upto now
Areas of improvement The quaility of plastic used is bad. It needs a lot of improvement. It would have been better had tata spend some money on better plastic quality.

Full Review 
 
I took a test drive of Mahindra Verito D4 in Mumbai on 30th May 2011. Here are my comments:
 
Exterior It’s all Mahindra now and they have removed Renault name and logo from the car. It gets Mahindra logo in the front, rear and on the center of steering wheel. Rear spoiler and appliqué looks posh and gives an image to the car. Body side mounting & cladding and roof rails gives enhanced looks though I feel that they are not required.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) No car in this category can beat the space Verito has. It had got ample headroom, legroom and shoulder space in the front and rear. Driving in Mumbai city traffic was really easy because of lots of driving leg space. Three adults can sit comfortably in the rear seat and they have one headrest for each of them which should help to make long journeys more relaxed.
Power window controls for front windows are on the centre console and for rear windows are in middle (behind the hand brake) but they are easily accessible to operate. A/C is powerful enough and the passengers at rear felt the cold air even at 2.
It has boot opener and fuel lid opener in the cabin but bonnet opener is on the front passenger side, it’s odd but it won't be used that frequently hence it’s ok.
Dash board is simple but informative. It has analogue tachometer but fuel and engine temperature indicators are digital on the LCD display. It also has on-board computer which displays Average fuel consumption, Average speed and Distance to empty. This is very useful for they who do frequent long journeys. There was no music system in the test drive vehicle.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox We drove in Mumbai city traffic for around an hour with A/C on but the fuel tank mark on the dashboard was showing empty!!! The dealer told that it has got around 8 liters of reserve and can go for another 100kms without refueling. I found the gear shifting very smooth. Clutch, brake and acceleration pedals were a bit hard but I guess they'll soften once used regularly.
 
Ride Quality & Handling I felt the power steering was hard but the dealer informed me its because the car is new and PDI is not done. It will improve after that. Otherwise the ride quality was really good, didn't feel and jerks while driving. Braking in traffic was very controlled.
 
Final Words Its spacious, runs well, suspensions are good. Overall it was a comfortable ride in Mumbai traffic. It’s a good attempt by Mahindra to get rid of Logan's taxi image. Mahindra will have to provide excellent after sales service if they want to make this car successful and not another taxi.
 
Areas of improvement Wipers turn from right to left. Some may find it odd!!! Top-end variant (D6) does not have USB enabled music system.

Full Review 
The Verito retains the Logan’s trapezoidal headlights. The front end though, gets restyled fog lights which give the bumper a more pronounced look. The front grille has been slightly redesigned to hoist the Mahindra logo and thankfully, doesn’t bring in the ‘bunny-tooth’ treatment from the Mahindra SUVs. The addition of chrome garnished roof rails adds a hint of sportiness to the Verito but doesn’t hamper the car’s wide-body image.
Get inside the car, familiarise yourself with the buttons and the layout and you immediately see the shortcomings of the cost cutting involved. No, I’m not talking about low-rent plastics or materials – in fact the materials used are quite satisfactory for a car of this category.
Yes, these are quite a few shortcomings but are easy to forget once you start appreciating the Verito’s comfort level – at the front and at the back. The seats are wide, cushy, come with adjustable seatbelts and are ergonomically designed as compared to the switches and levers in the car. The Verito’s back seat gets three headrests, therefore underscoring the fact that this rear bench is meant to seat three adults in comfort. The high roofline provides ample headroom for all passengers and imparts roominess to the cabin. The farthest I drove without a break was about 220 kms and none one of us in the Verito had any complaints about head/back/butt ache or motion sickness.Mahindra-VeritoThe air conditioning in the Verito is top notch. Even in the hottest temperatures the air-con still managed to cool the cabin in jiffy even on a hot Hyderabad afternoon. The Verito also has a pair of redesigned outside rear view mirrors (ORVMs) which are now bigger in size than the Logan’s. No electronic operation for these though, even on the top end model. The windows however get the electronic treatment but the switches are awkwardly placed and the auto-down/up function for the driver window is sorely missed. The Verito places a digital multi-information display in the instrumentation console which has read outs for the odometer, trip meter, range calculator, real time fuel economy, temperature gauge and the fuel gauge.
The Verito continues to use the Renault petrol and diesel engines. The 1.5-litre dCi diesel engine produces 65PS of power at 4,000 RPM and 160Nm of torque at 2,000 RPM. Start the engine and it settles into a muted burble which is on par with other diesel vehicles in its class like the Maruti Suzuki Swift DZire and Tata Indigo. At idling RPM, there is no handshaking vibration in the gearstick whatsoever. The clutch feels a tad heavy as compared to its competition and needs getting used to. I particularly do not like the way the Verito gets moving in first gear as the test mule felt very sluggish off the line. But once in second gear and past the 2,000 RPM mark, the 160 Nm of torque makes driving this car a breeze.Mahindra-VeritoThe Verito’s suspension is a big surprise. Around the bends the Verito holds its composure like none other in its segment – bettered only by the Ford Fiesta Classic. The Vertio comes with McPherson-type suspension upfront with a wishbone link. This setup gobbles broken roads and pot holes without a thud like an automatic vacuum cleaner that runs around the house gobbling every ounce of dirt lying on the floor without breaking a sweat. The steering feels well weighted around corners and on the straights but feels a tad too heavy for city use. It should make your forearms stronger, nevertheless.Verdict:Right from the beginning of this review, my tone must have got you to believe that I absolutely hate the Verito / Logan. But trust me, I’m far from it. As an automotive journalist, it is my duty to point out all the shortcomings of the vehicle, but as a true auto buff, it is next to impossible for me to hate the Verito after driving it for over 400 kms in three days. Yes, it does have those little niggles that Mahindra should have addressed during the transition. But these niggles are too small to ruin your experience in the Verito. It looks and feels very basic, but the engineering it top notch. Everything is so well put together that it just works like a charm. The car is comfortable in the city and on the highway. The engine is peppy and frugal. The suspension lets you push the car to its limits without any unnerving body roll and still manages to take care of the pot holes and broken roads without breaking your back. And this is why it is a hot favourite amongst fleet operators too – for the engineering just doesn’t fall apart.Mahindra-VeritoThat brings us back to two things – the price and the understated look. At Rs. 6.62-lakh (ex-showroom) for the top end diesel variant, the Verito is one of the cheapest diesel sedans as compared to its competitors. It completely warrants the price with its no-nonsense approach gives the entry level sedan buyers everything that they are looking for. Yes, the looks are understated and old school. But look at it this way, after a very extensive market research in India and after taking inputs from zillions of people, Toyota came up the highly successful Etios sedan which looks so much like the Verito / Logan. Do we still need more reasons to believe that understated and elegant designs coupled with the bare essentials are still in demand in India as compared to radical or overtly curvy, feature rich cars? I think not...
VERITO TRIVIA:Also a few things about this car which normally are not mentioned anywhere as they are not known to people.To start with Renault-Logan (A.K.A VERITO) is expensive because most of the body parts are still imported from Romania..., This car is basically designed for European countries like Romania, Slovakia, Serbia etc and its a budget sedan with good safety features. You will be surprised to know that the suspension of this car is that of Renault-Clios which is going to be soon made in India. Infact most of the parts are being shared from Renault-Clio and that's how they were able to keep down the costs. The Verito (Renault Logan) is the only other car apart from Volkswagen Vento which offers 5 years of Anti-corrosion body. Verito's (Renault Logan) body is made with 18mm steel which makes the car very heavy and strong. Also the car has amazing Off-Road capabilities due to excellent ground clearence of 172mm and due to very less body moving parts there is absolutely no rattles even after 3 lakh kms.This car is very cheap to maintain and the maintenance cost for every 10000 kms is not more than rs.3200/- . This car features a Variometric A/C which chills the car in no time. The tyres are also nice and thicker compared to other cars in this segment. Last but not the least this car poses a very big Boot of 510liters and it has one of the best N-Cap ratings in Europe.
Trust me...If One is not too particular about the Interiors you can close your eyes and go for the VERITO.

Exterior
 Verito has good looks from outside. This is my personal assessment. Many people find the car still like Logan (box shape etc.). Yet I feel that Verito, with small modifications, has an improved look. It seems to be a seasoned person's car, not for young people.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Cabin space is good. The car is wider than even the Manza. Three persons can sit comfortably in the back with ample leg room. Front seats are also quite wide and comfortable for long drives. There are some controls which are placed at odd places, but I feel that one gets used to them very soon. The indicators are placed on the left and it may take time to get used to them.
Quality of plastic, fabric etc. is good keeping in view the price of the car. One can not expect top end material in a car of this price range. Yet interior is pragmatic and should be OK with most of the  buyers.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The best part of the car is its engine and the power that it emits. Even though the diesel engine produces less power than manza, yet there was no lag in acceleraion and torque. In hills, torque is more important than power and Verito does the job appreciably. The gears are smooth. The brake padel is a bit hard (wooden feel it gives). But the engineer told me that it will become somewhat soft after some use.
Fuel economy is very good. Mahindra cars have lived up to their claims. Though I could not test the car for long duration, but what other users have told me the fuel efficiency is more than expected. I will get my car in a few days and I am going on a very long trip the same day testing the car in all sort of conditions. After that I will again write this review.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Handling of car is exceptionally good. Ride quality is fine and one feels comfortable. The steering is smooth and respsnsive. First time buyers should be careful with steering as it is very responsive. I did not get the feeling that I was driving a bigger car.
Final Words
 What I feel from the test drive, this car takes the cake. At this price point, one can not expect feature of very high end cars. But this car has all those features which are needed by a common user. Go for this car without a second thought. I said elsewhere that as a good looking girl may not be a good wife, so a very good looking car may not be the best option.
Areas of improvement
 Boot lid needs some more improvement. Audio system is needed in almost all the varients.

I'm an engineer and I test drive 8 to 10 cars before select verito. good sedan car in low price.
Exterior Its not looks so luxurious. but new feature like roof rails, rear spoiler and rear symbol-mahindra make look good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Nice comfort-suspension, negligible vibration even diesel engine. good space-3 person on rear seat can comfortably. For feature its not so good. All  r power windows but buttons r at wrong places. mp3 player is too cheap-just for show piece.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Overall performance is great. gear box is smooth. negligible engine noice & negligible vibration inside car. 18 kmpl with AC at 100 km/h speed and above 22 kmpl without AC. There is no effect of AC on acceleration in ghaat or hilly area.
Ride Quality & Handling Very smooth in handling, you can ride comfortably for long distance. large space for luggage. good controll with ABS. but airbags only one for driver only. Smoother even above 100 km/h.
Final Words Its not a luxurious look car like fiat linea or vento. but body material and safety features are of good quality.
Areas of improvement MP3 player, AC makes fan noice and not so effective like maruti-suzuki cars.

Full Review 
Exterior For a person like me exterior really does not matter with respect to this car because this car is intended for people who really need the car for usage rather than to flash off if one goes through the design it is straight where in case of any accident there would be less cost in fixing it Thecar was designed so that it was affordable to the average european people.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) For a budget car the interiors are reasonable in many reviews I have gone through I have noticed that people have complained about odd power window switches. My personal observation is that since the car is a budget car the idea is that the power window swithches are to be operated by driver and all the passengers in this case the driver can operate all the switches and the passengers can also operate individually the designetrs of this car have eleminated the excess wiring that would run to individual switches thereby reducing the failure and consequently the maintanence and i personally think that how many times do I have to open the windows during the travel and if i have to i can with small adjustments. i am personally happy that the indian manufacturers have not fiddeled with the europen designes if i go for this vehicle then i am guranted a proven europen pacakage so i dont really worried about the left hand drive interiors.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Before I went out to purchase this car i had gone through the reviews of many cars and had also taken the test rides I had gone through the specification of fiat engines toyota engines and renault engines toyota engine is 1.4 68/170 fiat engine is 1.3 70/190 renault engine is 66/160 my personal interpretation is that a bigger size engine is giving less power and smaller size engine is giving more power i equate this to a stronger man is made to do less work and a bit weaker man made to do more work so eventually in long run a weaker man is going get exhausted much earlier than the stronger man like wise eventually toyota and renault would be less maintance giving vehicles.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride and handling is good and it is not ment to race for family purpose it is nice.
Final Words Good sturdy practical and economical car.
Areas of improvement Lots of room for improvement espacially to adapt to right hand drive provided the change does not compremise the quality.

Exterior Looks nice with all the new extra sporty fittings.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Topend Diesel D6 has all the topend features except for the Alloys & Leather seats.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Superb performance, excellent fuel economy & very smooth gear box.
Ride Quality & Handling Awesome ride quality, strong suspentions which are a must for indian roads & amazing ride quality.
Final Words I have decided to go for this car after reading all the reviews and consulting 100's of drivers including TAXI fellows who have been driving this car since the launch of LOGAN.
Areas of improvement Interiors can be Improved, Look and Style are well designed with straight line features which are always good then the bend curved designed cars specially for the sedan one. The side mirrors are better then the  previous which adds to its looks and also the spoilers which perfectly  fits with the car. The car rear wind glass is a wide one which no other  car has and comes with this price tag. Comfort then No comparison with any mid size sedan car it has awsome space and comforts. Pickup No problemit is good in town and excellent on highway.
Mileage my GLX 1.4 petrol has given mileage of  19.5km/ltr.I was really amazed to see this and in town it gives me the  mileage of 13.5km/ltr.
Best Features Its looks and study engine with the boot space. Needs to improve on the inside features. Overall Experience till now since I purchased my car is excellent and I haven't invested any amount on my car except purchasing of petrol.

Please note, a person purchasing a full option vehicle, he is expecting a company fitted full loaded vehicle. In Verito D6, i am shocked by seeing ordinary spare wheel in dickey. If i noticed it before delivery, i may re think in purchase Verito. For an amount of 3000-4000, why mahindra do this type of cheap adjustments. The spare wheel may be used at any time. Imagine a vehicle running in 3 alloy wheel and one ordinary wheel in city. It is like a man walking with shoe in one leg and chapel in another. So it is very bad that u give a D6 owner only 4 alloy wheel only. I don't know is there any other adjustments maid by Mahindra in any other places too. We love Mahindra because Mahindra in an Indian Brand, we expect a lot of from u. Don't spoil it by doing  cheap adjustments. 
Thank u, best wishes.

Exterior Though its not one of the best things to look at on the road, but the design keeps it very stable. The driver visibility is very good and it keeps the car stable at very high speeds.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space is unmatched, We are a family of very well built people and all 5 of us can sit in the car comfortably. However, the interior plastic quality is a little inferior, the door opening and closing handles inside seem to be just put there without any thought. They do make a little noise when you are trying to open/close the door. If you keep the car in the sun for a long time it smells of burning plastic.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox This is the killer, I bought the verito because of its amazing fuel efficiency. I clock 20.4kmpl  in a city like bangalore with AC on at all times. At highways i have got 25.9 kmpl, I also have a photograph to prove it. That makes the efficiency better than what Honda Amaze currently advertises. There is no turbo lag and at lower gears there is enough power to go up a steep hill with 5 people inside. The gearbox also was easy to use even for my wife who was using an I10 earlier. 
Ride Quality & Handling The Ride quality is great because of the strong suspension and i have noticed that if you have more people in the car the better it drives. The fastest that i drove the car was about 145 Kmph and it was very stable and handled curves very well.
Final Words I am in Sales and Verito comes as a welcome gift, the fuel efficiency and the space at this price is unimaginable. I have made my choice and have driven for around 11k kms in about the 4 months since I bought the car and am really happy to have made the decision.
Areas of improvement The only area of improvement is the interior plastic quality and the hard steering. Apart from that the car has got most of the things right.

Exterior Exterior is good. looks like a luxarious car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are average. Car is very spacious and comfortable in driving.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is good except the noise of the engine is very high. I purchased D4 on feb-10-2012 and have driven 1900 km till date. But the noise of the engine is high and sounds like a heavy vehicle. even neighbours have pointed this to me. However I am expecting this noise to be reduced after first service which is due shortly. The Fuel economy is excellent. till now it has given 23.1 KM/L. Gear box is ok as it feels to make some sound during driving. Let me check up with the service workshop about this.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good. very comfortable in driving. But applying  breaks does not seems comfortable at speed higher than 100KM/Hr on highways. (I travel daily around 100 kms on highway from my home to office and back).
Final Words It is a good car for those who travels long distance daily and on highways.
Areas of improvement Engine noise, Brakes.

Exterior Good exteriors.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Spacious and comfortable
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smooth drive and gives 21 kmpl consistently
Ride Quality & Handling Smooth ride, no complaints about the vehicle performance.
Final Words As a product, the vehicle is very good. I am satisfied 100% with the performance of the vehicle. But the after sales service is really pathetic. Especially in AML Ranigunj, Secunderabad, AP. 
Areas of improvement Please improve on the after sales service. Buyers, check with the service centers before buying the product, otherwise, you will be struck with the car. The car performance is good and to the mark, as the manufacturer has promised, but the service should improve. 
Some suggestions:
1. Check with the service centers before buying the vehicle. 
2. Talk to the managers of the service centers before giving the vehicle for service.
3. Check and double check for the prices of all the items which the service centers quotes for parts and services. Especially, in the AML motors Ranigunj, Secunderabad, AP. Just for interior cleaning, I was charged Rs. 2250.00 and nothing has been done inside the car.

Hi, its Kalidass from Chennai, Proud to own a Verito D4.
I have taken the verito three weeks before. It gave me 20.4 KM/L for the first filling and 22.8 in the second filling. My average drive is around 100-110 Km per day. Maintained 1500-1700 RPM for the running in period and even in this rpm the speedometer clocked 100 some times. Driving control is good.
The console in the interior is not up to the standard and is not user friendly. Reaching and adjusting the AC controls, power window controls is very difficult. Good leg room in front and back as well.The wiper probably designed for the Left hand drive vehicle and is not suitable for the right hand drive. Needs more improvement to tackle the wiper issue where the visibility in the rainy conditions is horrible, it difficult to view in the right hand side during rain. have to turn your entire body and head for a right turn in rain. The ugly finish of the body over the tyres spoils the look of the vehicle, even you see the rear view mirror the projection over the tyres blocking some visibility.
The engine noise being felt inside the cabin is due to the poor interior fixing/design or packing the gaps. The Engine is absolutely fine and smooth and for times while cursing, you may feel that you are driving a petrol vehicle. Unlike some diesel variants in the market hatchback/sedan, the vibration is not at all been felt inside the cabin while starting or on run or while switching off.
But for the sub 7.1L car still can be the best choice for those who are looking for hatchbacks in terms of space, mileage, price, comfort. This is best choice for the middle class people with good decent vehicle and comfort. have to the Support/Service from Mahindra in the coming months.
If Mahindra's R&D Team hears from customers on their feedbacks directly not from the call centre, then they may change the image of this vehicle altogether and can compete with all leading brands and preferred cars by the Indian users.

Exterior Lake Electrical Adjustable ORVM, It's better if given Electrical adjustable with Ele fold option also.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Individual power Window Operation Switches should be given...Back seat Arm Rest is missing, that should be added. Three head rest is good, Below middle head rest arm rest with cup holders is needed to be added.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox For Deisel Engine. Its little bit underpower. But its ok considiring prize of the dar.
Ride Quality & Handling Its really good, road grip is really good even at high speed, even at changing lanes with speed, its go confident.
Final Words Overall grate buy, value for money prodcuts, only some changes is required. Mahindra face lifted Logan to Varito, bot some basec chages did not do, this was very much required.
Areas of improvement Some Changes Required - like Electrical ORVM. Power window Switches to all Windows, Front Passenger Air Bag etc, Arm Rest middle of the back seat, under middle heat rest, so in case of two people traveling, hen can be more comfort at back seat. Alloy wheels can also be added to enhance more road grip in top Verson of Diesel.

Exterior When I first saw the new Verito D6 in show room, I could not believe it is the same derivative of Logan. Having seen many new cars in the lower price range, was really delighted to get all the features of D6 ( ABS, Driver Air Bag, Motorized ORM, etc).
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Without comparing Apples with Oranges, I was quit satisfied with the Interiors. Largest space in the segment,  decent comfort & features. Blue tooth lie feature would have made it still better. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox It is just less than 2 month since having purchase and having driven 4000KM both in city and on Highways,  Engine performance Is quite decent.  Having driven many cars in this segment the feature I liked most was there is no practically Turo-lag, one can easily manage bums & city traffic in 2 & 3rd gear easily. The acceleration and pickup is very close to petrol engines. Sufficient power for all conditions city traffic or highway. 
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is quite good and meets my expectation for city and highway conditions For an average normal user like me.Not being fast zipping nor racing type my review is not with respect to that Class of driving. I had never understood the meaning of ABS until I successfully avoided hitting a straying lady on the high way driving at 80-90 KM. Another best feature is the ground clearance and suspension is so good that till date I have not rubbed a single bump on the road Having driven 4000KM. 
Final Words I am happy having settled down to Verito D6.
Areas of improvement Features like bluetooth, passenger side airbags.

Exterior Much more improved when comparing its earlier versions,New curves and boot have remarkably reduced  its boxy looks,Good colour to choose,Still needs more work to prove its competency.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Un-beatable space,enhanced looks,better plastic quality,Fabric seats gets dirty easily,things missing in D2 model comparing D4 model is not justifyable for the price difference of only 20K.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Little rough in the begining and gets smoother after 3rd gear,Engine noise level is low inside the cabin, Gave 21kmpl during my first visit from Bangalore to Coimbatore before 1st service,Smooth transmission and churnsout enough power to glide on Highways. Didn't feel tired or back pain after continuous ride from Chennai to bangalore  for 5.5 hrs.
Ride Quality & Handling Thanks to its good road clearance,I could confidantly ride over rough roads without any hesitations, Great suspension yet not much of body roll,Easy to handle feels like handling a small car, No vibration is felt on high speeds.
Final Words If you wanna spacious, sufficiently powered, plenty of boot spaced,crash proof,high fuel economy,less maintanance and a car with proven records.... please go for Verito.... You cannot find another car of this segment with same price range and the features in the current car market,I am proud to be a verito Man.

Exterior The exterior is not eye catching but is good enough to get comfortable with.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) There is good space,but not very pampering.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine is excellent and if a person maintains 2500rpm the milage is terrific(20-21).
Ride Quality & Handling For me personaly the car fullfils all my needs perfectly. 
Final Words I have driven the car for around 10000kms on all types of roads it is a no nonsence practical car, good mileage, tough suspension, and dependable.The car handles all terrains without any problems.I use it off road some times in my farm and do not have any difficuilty.The car has a heavy body like all mahindra vehicles, so the car sticks to the road during turns at speed.Over all it is a good car for the varing Indian conditons, good roads bad roads,rain or hot weather(excellent A/C) and you have a mahindra dealer nearly every where in the country if you get into any problems.
Areas of improvement More powerful headlights are needed.

Exterior Front looks are awesome with the big hexagonal grill with crome and fog lamps also with crome rings and wing mirrors have turn indicator with slight crome accent the genouers cuts and lines on all over the body but overall Fludic desing is toned Down. Side profle looks decent yet smart with watline moulding to protect from small dents and scrtches. one important thing is that rear looks are not as good as on the Grand I10 but boot is nicely integrated. also roof go small micro roof antenna. wnidshild washers are nicely intergragted too. Good saftey feature is That rear defogger is standard in mid spec variant. Very helpful feature is that keyless entry button on the door handle, no need to take key out of pocket simply hit the black request sensonr car will automatically unlock/lock along with side mirrors gets fold when car get locked/unlocked.    
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior Layout is very good and user friendly too, Quality levels are excellent and plastic feels soft on the hand. overall there is no ergonomic issue. Feautres are best in the Segment Even a Segment high, Auto Foldable ORVM's, tilt stering with audio/bluetooth and trip computers controls. center consle is very rich on quality and in features. As there is Mp3/cd/usb/aux/blutooth concetivity and 1Gb internal memory Hardirve also there is a unique feature called sound sestivity setting, as when car's speed increses audio sound goes down. FATC fully automatic climate control A/C is very effective and chills the car in no time along with the rear A/C vents adds to uniform cooling. Gearbox position is very convinent and it is very easy to use. both stearing wheel and gear knob are leather wrapped and crome is geneoursly used. Back sets have armrest with two cup holders and adjustable headrests. Talking about space Legroom and head room are quite good and no one will feels it short. only problem is of the width it is good for 4 persons but not for 5. though quality of seats fabric are good and they will lastlongs even the boots fabric is the best in the segment boot is very large and can swallow weekend trip luggage. Rear Camera and parking sensors are boon in city conditions.  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 1.1 U2 Crdi engine is not as qucik as Honda Amaze 1.5 idtec it is not even has that sudden surge of Troque that is been deliverd by 1.3 MJD but this engine impress on NVH levels and power dilivery is linear and on can easily curise on above 100 speeds till 120 kmph after this engine lacks juice. still form 0-100 no one will find any problem and overtaking is not an issue although.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is top notch as NVH levels are low and suspension absorbs most of the bumps and there is minimal body roll. stearing is light and very easy on hand in cramped spaces ride at high or low speed is well stable due to bigger alloys. cornering is not good as that of the amaze. 
Final Words Best to buy car for that person whom want more from less. because Xcent top is nearly 41000 chep than the amaze top variant. Good Features Space and styling and decent engine performance. Best to Buy No Second Thought.
Areas of improvement Engine should be 1.4 CRDI Same as that of i20 or Verna. Rear looks shuold be redesinged and width is to be more. nothing else Overall good Car

Exterior Neatly integrated boot, hyundai body panels and paint job are at par as compared to others in this segment (Much much better that swift or dzire, 3 yrs user of dzire Zdi )
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Best in class features, no other cars in this segment has this many features. VFM. Space is just adequate, reat seat comfort is very good as compared to i20( i20 feels like sitting in a school bench). inclined position in xcent.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine power is linear as u wont  found the punch when turbo kicks as in 1.3 MJD. ideal for city drivinig as no turbo lag which is much hesitaitng to drive my dzire in city.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good, steering response is very good and not too heavy or too light as compared to i20, i20 feels disconnected even in high sppeds, which is and issue in safety point of view. suspensions are well tuned for indian roads, but i liked the suspensions in petrol variant, is there any diff. in petrol and diesel variant.
Final Words I loved the vehicle so much that i sold my dzire top end diesel variant and booked the diesel S(o) variant, going to be delivered on 30th May.
Areas of improvement ABS could be a standard from second variant onwards, atleast driver side airbags to be provided in S and S(0) variants.

Exterior I booked  the car the very first day when bookings opened and was one of the first people to receive the vehicle in Hyderabad.I picked up the top end Sx O diesel variant.The front portion of the car is pleasing with the big air dam and nice head lights, it's got a well planted look as far as the front end is concerned. The profile of the car is very balanced and the boot is neatly integrate, the diamond cut 15" alloys add to the profile look and fill the wheel wells adequetly. The rear of the car is bland and narrow. Very simple and plain but we'll suite to the car, maybe something more tdone to the rear styling would have looked overdone, nevertheless it's acceptable.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) This is the place which sold the car to me , the design , fit and finish and features are top notch and would not feel out of place in a car which is a segment higher. The controls on the steering wheel are very intuitive to use and all controls are appropriately placed.the stereo connects easily with the phone and sound quality is quite acceptable. One thing which requires special mention is the gear knob, it's got a very good finish and is of a very high quality. The only grouce I have with car's interior is that the front seats could do with more coushioning and the car does not lock automatically. The ac of the car is very good and makes the cabin a very comfortable Place to be in. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine of the car (diesel) is very responsive in the city and there is minimal turbo lag, the low end and mid range is the forte of the engine and city driving is very comfortable with its linear power delivery, the top end is where the car looses its breath and its advisable to keep the engine in the mid range to use it effortlessly. I've driven the car on highways as we'll and the car can cruise easily at speeds of 120 to 130 , above which you need the work a little harder with gearbox and engine. The gearbox is very smooth and a joy to use. The engine noise in the cabin is minimal as compared to other diesel engined cars. I got around 17-18 kmpl on the highway ( May be due to the spirited driving) and around 13 in city. In extreme traffic conditions it gives around 11.
Ride Quality & Handling The ride quality of the car is not very absorbent and bad patches of road do filter in, the suspension is a bit on the stiffer side, otherwise its pretty comfortable. The handling of the car is very good in the city and the car is very easy to use in the congested roAds of the city, on the highway the ride quality a more than acceptable.
Final Words The built of the car is very good and you get pampered the features on offer, go for the top end models as they are fully loaded and make the car an interesting place to spend time in. If city driving is what you do mainly then you cannot get a better deal at this price.
Areas of improvement The brakes need to have more bite and more colour options should be available.

Exterior Being the addition on Grandi10 the front looks are not new. From Back side Hyundai has really invested good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Lot many features which you can find in the top model of Grand i10 but not in any other car of the same compact sedan segment. You will not find all the below features in one car like foldable and auto close side mirrors, rear ac vents, extra boot space, boot light lamp, driver seat adjustable, glove box cooling, parking sensors, bluetooth phone, etc.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is optimal for the power & fuel economy and Gearbox is easy to handle. Hyundai has taken out the max power from engine and to give max fuel economy as what else can you expect more from the 1.1 capacity.
I took the test drive of the diesel car and found a bit less powered as compared to the Grand i10 diesel.
Ride Quality & Handling You may feel the suspensions not that great but the handling is relaxing on city roads.
Final Words A superior car than Amaze and Dzire. Good to go and book it, since people already know the performance of Grand i10.
Areas of improvement Wheel base should be increased to get more leg rrom & space, interior color, quality of seats in material and comfort.

Exterior Very good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Could have added more features, like fuel economy, outside temp, trip for time, chrome finish. After driving i20 for the past 5 years, i found this sedan way behind i20., which is of same price.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Gears are really smooth,  just week time old ,SX optional Diesel version, the cabin is not so  quiet could  feel the noise of engine. Engine performace is excellent, fuel economy is very poor, , the mileage ,just another typical Hyundai car, this one too really disappointing, am getting only 12.5km/ltr , (City/Highway) . 40lts Diesel after delivery, i could run only 500km.
Ride Quality & Handling Got a very good  riding comfort, could not tried over 100km/hr speed  as its a new engine.. overtaking is comfaortanble, the vehicle is good for speeds upto 100.
Final Words I would suggest i20 over this car
Areas of improvement Fuel economyExterior Hyundai has maintained its fluidic concept from the front side, Overall from lookwise Xcent scores 8/10, Alloy wheels & chrome finish adds to the looks of the car.Only limitation is with the colour availablity.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) This is the real place where it leaves a impression the quality of plastic is good biege & black colour is a perfect combination, bluetooth in audio system makes cell phone handling very easy, all controls of audio are on the steering wheel
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Gears are smooth, I have purchased SX optional Diesel version, the cabin is very quiet will not be able to feel the noise or vibrations of the engine.Mileage is not confirmed but will definitely be good as on the first day i drove 350 Km & diesel is still more than half the tank.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride is smooth amongst its class, overtaking is comfaortanble, the vehicle is good for speeds upto 100 to 110, after that it gets a bit sluggish although i didnt tried much as its a new engine.

Exterior I bought this on December , year end offer, almost 50 to 60k discoount to loose one year on 2014 year model. Good in all side except the rear side, but rear is not ugly in my view.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior awesome, less noise for Diesel version  most of the time won't feel like driving a diesel car.
Space is decent but not surplus, for a family this is perfect and I liked the less width  as most of the time usage is at narrow city traffic.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox This is not a sporty car but very good family car. Fuel economy is good, I don't have real figures to update here, will post later point. Gear box is smooth only. This car is easily drivable by ladies as well. 
We had Alto early after 5 years of its usage upgraded to this .  keeping priorities safety , comfort  and easy to drive in city.
Ride Quality & Handling It is stable at high speeds , but scary to press beyond 120km , In my view for safety reason it is not advisable to  go beyond 100km speed. whatever technology we have there will be limitations, better to be  safe rather reaching 30 mins or 60 mins before by pressing too hard on the pedal.
Final Words Good family car which covers most of the aspects, comfort, safety, style, economy. Fresh look in the market, rear look is not very attractive but in my view defenitely it is not ugly as Ritz(ofcourse Ritz is  different segment).
Areas of improvement Rear look, adjustable head rest in front seats,  dark grey  and more colour option.

Exterior The Car is a decent looking car considering the price it is offered for. Ir doesnt stand amongst the most stylish cars but its a decent and good looking family car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The Car comes with all basic features and additional add ons which are greatr at the price tag. it is comfortable for driving and can seat two people comfortably at the back. It can accomodate three od sized individuals at the back with efforts.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The car is good to drive in the city traffic. It has a smooth and comfortable feeling. As it is low on power one can just feel a bit of lag when on the highway. But a regular car user who really does not prefer to Zoom around qt high speeds will love the drive. I have been checking my average regulary. It gives me around 18 kmpl minimum in the city traffic for my diesel car, which I am happy and satisfied with. depending on the traffic situation the average may slighly vary but it has never gone beyond the 17 mark ever. the Gear box is well placed and comfortable.

Exterior: Was best in class until Ford Aspire was launched.                                                         
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Interior is best in class, you get all the features that you might need, a rear AC vent, charging point and Chiller glove Box is the best you can get in this category, I might add.                                                                                              
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: You get only 70 BHP compared to its other rivals which give at least 90 but still I never felt a power lagg. Its smooth like butter and its so well insulated that you barely hear anything inside the room. Fuel economy is fairly good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                         
Ride Quality & Handling: Best steering wheel in class.                                                              
 
Final Words: I've not driven Aspire yet, but this one is the best.
 
Areas of improvement: They need to sort the braking issue and the tyres seem a bit small.

Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Worst fuel economy of 8 km vs 18.8 promised. No response even after raising warranty. The dealer sundaram motors worst service and working berocratic. No personal touch from chevy and TVS top management. kept the car in TVS workshop for 15 days 3 occasions. TVS staff arrogant. Police criminal being filed on top management of both companies and legal notice being served. Don't buy.
Ride Quality & Handling Heavy noise like a road roller, clutch, gear worst performance. Can't move in 1st and second Gear. u have to give full clutch for moving in 1st or 2nd gear.
Final Words Dont buy chevy any ptoduct.
Areas of improvement warranty not not given proper importance. Worst fuel economy of 8 km vs 18.8 promised. No response even after raising warranty.

Exterior Good exterior with strong body structure.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior quality should be improved. plastic used in interior is very poor and low quality. AC is not working properly when out side temperature is above 35. very specious car and boot space is also good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Ggood engine performance and pickup too. fuel economic is avg. feeling little jerk in 3rd gear. pick up is disturbed when ac on. 
Ride Quality & Handling Smooth ride with low noice. horn is quite hard and it is in side. so in traffic or while turning it is difficult to use horn.
Final Words In this price range it is good. but one can go for fiat linea classic or ford classic and in compact sedan can go for honda amaze or tata zest
Areas of improvement Interior should be imporved with good quality of plastic and other material. AC should also be improved. horn is very hard and its location is also odd. it should be in the center of the stearing.

Exterior
 I Purchased Whitw colour it gets dirty verty soon but looks classic every time i see it
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 I am more than satisfied with the interrior, one must use the dashboard polish to give a shiny look to the blacks , I got Sails leather seat covers , and its just perfect for my car colour. This car is specious , better than Maruti swift dezire. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine is turbocharged , you can feel the instant pickup when you press the acceletor hard. I used this car as a cab in Kolkata and the city Average milage is 17-18 on ac and 20 on National highways on ac . There is now powerloss in the engine when the Ac is on.
Ride Quality & Handling
 I am more than satisfied with the Confort in the car ride quality is exactly what i expected and its good .
Final Words
 I was in a fix either to buy drzire VDI or SAIL LS Disel , as i have been a Maruti user since ages. But after using it for 3 months and driving it for 4000Kms i feel that i should buy another SAIL as said i use them as Cabs to ferry passengers and this is the perfect car that caters my needs.  
Areas of improvement  
 Chevrolet should try to reduce the noise of the engine, They should increase the Hight and provide a better Central Locking (should make sound while unlocking).

Exterior Beautiful exterior with honda look. Everything is being written so far and people already know about it.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very much impressive. Specially back seat...was not expecting such a roomy cabin from outside. But once u get in. It is really space for two adult and one kid. On reas seat. No complaint. Perfectly ok for small family.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Drove for only 2 km on SG road ...was not able to take it to 100+ speed .but smooth start. Very smooth acceleration ...very precise needed boost by diesel engine, was expecting to have little longer driver on high way for 100+ speed..but it was too busy at honda show room on SG road. Jigar -sales rap is just perfect. gear box is smooth. Gear shifting is fine. Personally i am not in fav of roaring engine noice but it is accepetable for new enginer specially made of alluminium. Somapre to micra, renault pulse. These noice is acceptable. I own maruti swift and after dribing 100000 km. It is still very much balanced, smooth and old 1300 cc engine  has been fun to drive so far. Looking for change and buying amaze for sure. It is absolutely alternative for desire.
Ride Quality & Handling Very smooth ride quality. I took test drive with 5 healthy friend each weight 70+ kg, and it was perfectly balanced , no shortage of power. Very much smooth accleration and perfect breaks.
Final Words I have already given booking for Amaze. Expecting ASAP and have some change. My review is not biased at all for liking honda over desrie or swift. I have been enjoying swift LDI for 5 years. It is just a new car in portfolio. for city drive. 
Areas of improvement I have taken very short test drive and observed a  little diesel engine noise, in side cabin. But I feel it is okay for me specially u are driving with music system on and enjoying cornering and extra power u are getting from 1500 cc. If honda can work on making extra silent cabin. That would definately screw rest of the maket in this sagment for sure. No doubt at all.

I have bought Amaze Dsl and not quite satisfied with the driving feel and quality of the product. I have an experience of working with Automobile companies like Fiat, Mahindra, Hyundai and driven and experienced a lot of cars from the same. I have faced the below issues by now and this makes the drive feel quite bad.
1. shaking: The car shakes a lot during slow speeds and great shifts.
2. Top Speed: No matter the care is a 1.5ltr engine but it does not allow the car to exceed a top speed of 145kmph which was clearly known during our trial run.
3. Humming Frt Wheels : There is huge humming sounds which is quite disturbing, this might be due to the incorrect Tyre size or the hardness of the Tyre.
4. RPM Fluctuations: At times when we shift the gear to 3rd gear the speed raves up to 40kmph and goes on increasing and at time the speed is normal between 20kmph to 30kmph.
5. Engine Vibrations : During acceleration it is found that the car shakes alot and there is a lot a vibration which can be felt inside the car compartment on the seats while driving.
6.Fuel Efficiency: It is quite poor against the claim made by Honda, I get a fuel efficiency of 16kmpl at the max. It is a diff of about 40% against the claim made by Honda. I had always expected it to be around 20kmpl.
7.RR Wheel Arch PVC covers are also missing creates the car alot messy and dirty in rainy season.
I think there are lot teething issues which honda should consider.

Exterior Excellent looks from outside.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Features needs to work up on, Spacious(Excellent management of space in sub 4 mtr car by Honda Enginners), Comfortable on City roads as well as on Bumpy roads.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Being Aluminum cast engine it is bit noisy at lower gears(But with Music on you hardly heard it), further engine performs well with no Turbo Lag, Mileage- I am getting 20/ltr with AC on in Delhi and I think will get more on Long Drives on highways, Gearbox Performs well and changing gera is a delight(Very smooth).
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is excellent and handling is very good.
Final Words My experience with this car is really amazing and it is based on my own experience as a proud owner of Honda Amaze EX MT IDTEC. In case you need any help my contact number is 9871XXXXXX.
In addition to above I want to add that the person who actually wants to know more about actual end user experience of this car can visit to respective workshop in their city and directly inquire from the owner of Honda Amaze (Who have come their for Servicing of vehicle) regarding there experience with it. It really helps in taking the final call even I have done the same before Owning this car. Thanks.
Areas of improvement Interiors needs to be improved and some features like Cigar lighter and automatic closing of doors after a certain speed can be added.

Areas of improvement Charging point required in emt and exmt, cant fix wheel cap on entry level version, cd player with sd card, nvh level heard about.
Note.1) BUY Bajaj insurance on your own. you will save 4000/- 2) avoid road side assistance as Bajaj insurance cover it. you will save 1700 x 4 yrs= 4500. 3) don't buy extended warranty you will save 7000/-. as in 1st & 2 yrs of Honda warranty you will learn whether the engine is perfect or defective. During the 2 yrs. Warranty, if you feel that you still want to go for an extended warranty before the expiry of your original Honda warranty, you can buy it. 4) Honda Amaze – Diesel comes with ABS and EBD braking 5) Fuel average is the best. 6) In Honda Amaze EMT and EXMT you do not get charging point. The roadside shopkeepers with a dual harness pull out a charging point, the 1st point goes to the deck and 2nd goes to the charging point. Both consume 12 Volts each from single wire that has 12 volts (single) fuse. Honda can void warranty with such alteration. And please avoid cigarette lighter for sure, as it requires 15 Volt. In such a scenario its better to by SMT petrol or diesel.7) You cannot fit wheel cap in base variant.8) Mr. Latish - LINK WAY Honda Andheri (east), Mumbai - 9223XXXXXXThis is the only way you can save money on Honda Thanks & Regards,Ajay Rath

Exterior Amaze Car look like to Shift D'zire with new Exterior style.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)  Interior is really good with attractive features compared to other cars in the segment. ABS With EBD in all variant of Diesel good safety feature for all Variants, space is good and confort is good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I have test drive Diesel Variant the Engine is very  Noisy the pickup is good, nothing to say about  the Fuel Economy at this time. Gear shifting is very good. Turning radios is good.
Ride Quality & Handling Seating comfort is Good, Pick-Up is good. But Honda Amaze Suspension is hard can't get the feel of Honda Brand. Clutch is hard.
Areas of improvement Honda Need to reduce the diesel engine noise, Clutch is hard - driving in city traffic jam will be painful, Need to improve in Ground clearance.
My Overall Experience on Honda Amaze is good. But the car delivery waiting period for Diesel S Variant  3-4 months and for V variant the waiting Period is nearly 5 months in Hyderabad(India).

Final Words Not for Honda Users. It is for low end and not worth.
Areas of improvement If you want to deliver a product to a customer, dont make a demand. First of all you people get all approvals from RTO, Goverments, to make customer service at better level. I own Honda City and when we bought before 7 Years earlier, their response towards customers were quite good.
But now, as if we are all beggers waiting for free products from Honda. We are paying money for the product we buy from our pocket & not from your pocket. So learn your mistakes!!! or you will be out of the market soon.!!!

Exterior Better than Maruti DZIRE, Exposed A/C condensor prone to small pebbles from the front, A/C Fan for condensor is too loud.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Seats could be better with adjustible headrests, USB connector is like a wire tail and is embarassing, dashboard is not sturdy and shakes when touched.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Diesel Engine is noisy, coolant fan is loud, The fuel meter on console shows average as 11-12 kmpl.
Ride Quality & Handling GOOD. 
Final Words Honda dealers are not able to match delivery promises. When booking, they said delivery will begin in April 2013. Now they say wait till May end. Poor Show. Personally I feel, competititers should throw in some promotions to cash on over this situation of Over Promise-Under deliver.
Areas of improvement Climate Control should be standard. Seats must be improved. Adjustible head rests are missing. Increase wheel size to R15 is a must. Protect the A/C condensor from stray stones. OVRM should be free to move in case of pressure from passing vehicle touching the OVRM case. Delivery period must improve drastically.

Bought Honda Amaze Diesel SMT I Dtec. Its 1500 cc engine. it`s a sedan car. Exterior Look : 1) Is very Good                  Interior Look : 1) Interior look is goodAdvantage :1) Good Power 98 BHP for diesel car 2) Honda Amaze – Diesel comes with ABS and EBD breaking3) Fuel average in city is 16.1 kms & highway is 22 kms. Fuel saving in Diesel car is 14.286% per year x 7 years     = 100% saving in 7 years.4) shock-up are software and better than Dzire. 5) Clutch oil make the clutch soft. I have not seen in Dzire or I may have to check. I also own a swift Dzire6) synchronizing the gears as mentioned below, you will feel the difference. It will also increase fuel efficiency.    Focus a bit more on RPM. Initially you may find it hard, but once you get the hang of it, you will automatically     reduce your acceleration and your car will automatically roll in one gear and eco lite will be constantly be on.     In this way your gear shifting will reduce. When you shift to 1st gear you can pull your car to 1500 RPM. At 1500 RPM, shift to 2nd gear, then on every 2000 RPM change gear so you don't strain the engine. Only in climbing you pull it to 2500 RPM. Most of the time eco lite will be on and average and engine life will be good and the drive will be very smooth. 7) Every Service is after 6 months.Dis-advantage:1) Insurance: Don’t buy insurance from Honda,      a) Insured Declared Value (IDV) is low.    b) Passenger Driving the car cover is 50,000/- Per Person x 1 person = Rs. 5,0000/-    c) Co-Passenger Cover is Rs. 50,000/- Per Person x 4 persons           = Rs. 2,00000/-    d) Road side assistance has to be bought separately from Honda.    e) key and lock replacement by honda is not covered        whereas if you buy your own insurance of  Bajaj insurance you get higher cover to 1,0000/-.    it also covers road side assistance and key and lock replacement as well.2) Music System: Music system Provided by Honda: 2 Din music system is bad. No CD /DVD player, No SD card slot. It is limited to USB and AUX. Understanding that number of people buying CDs has reduced but at-least they should have considered DVD Player provision and reverse camera provision and Map option.     Front Speaker : They are bad no Magnet at all. You can fix alpine speakers 6.5 inches. The depth of speaker should be 3 inches and the door depth is 3 inches. so to space it from the door there is a space ring of .25 inch, so that the speaker does not touch the door. The original speakers come with space ring.  Back Speaker : They are bad. You can fix alpine speakers 5.25 inches. The depth of speaker should be 3inches and the door depth is 3 inches. so to space it from the door there is a space ring of 3 inch, so that thespeaker does not touch the rod that is in the dicky passing horizontally. you dont get space ring with 5.25 inches speakers. 
 
3) Extended Warranty: Don't buy extended warranty you will save 6800/-. As in 1st & 2 yrs. of Honda warranty you will learn whether the engine is perfect or defective. The next extended warranty is covered by the dealer and not by Honda India. During the 2 yrs. Warranty, if you feel that you still want to go for an extended warranty before the expiry of your original Honda warranty, you can buy it. 4) Charging Socket: In Honda Amaze EMT and EXMT you do not get charging point. The roadside shopkeepers with a dual harness pull out a charging point From, THE AUDIO SOCKET. The 1st point goes to the deck and 2nd goes to the charging point. Both consume 12 Volts each from single wire that has 12 volts (single) fuse. Honda can void warranty with such alteration. And please avoid cigarette lighter for sure, as it requires 15 Volt. In such a scenario, it`s better to by SMT petrol or diesel.5) Wheel Caps: You cannot fit wheel cap in base variant. Very Very Sad.6) Power Window Buttons : They should have illuminated window button specially on drivers side as they are 4 buttons. in dark it becomes difficult to see the buttons, as which you want to press to roll down or slide up.7) Security Alarm : if some un-authorized person tries to open the door, engine bonet, luggage compartment or breaking the glass, for all this they should have sensors and security Alarm.8) Gps Tracking Service : Honda should provide Gps car tracking system if car is stolen so it can be tracked. they should have an arrangement with some reputed GPS Tracking Company.

Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Dash needs to be replaced. its less spacious. Top model has fabric seats.lots of cost cutting in amaze.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Honda Engine is reliable any time but iDtec-it needs lots of improvisation. Good stunning responsive engine. Pick up is awesome even at third gear. Inside the city traffic it is the rock star. Because it will make the driver quite easy to drive.Braking no doubt. very good. Honda People say you will get a fuel economy around 20 per litre. Lets hope for the best. Next is gear shift. Gear shift is good. But the knock from the gear was not very much impressing me.But still good.
Ride Quality & Handling Front suspensions isnt good,it needs a good replacement
Final Words Buy if u really need good mileage at lower cost
Areas of improvement Interiors and engine,INSULATION PART SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF. ABLE TO HEAR THE ROAD NOISE. IMPROVEMENT IN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WHEEL AND THE BODY(A LONG GAP IS SEEN).Please do improvement in door latch areas.

Honda Amaze Complaints: Honda Amaze Stopped Only 1 - 1.5 ft Water
I am here with a really bad experience with HONDA. My trust within this brand shattered when my newly purchased (only 2 months back) HONDA AMAZE stopped only in 1 - 1.5 ft water. When I bought this car, I was communicated that I should not opt self start this vehicle. I followed the same and I even did not try to start the engine. All other vehicles including Alto, Wagon R,Swift ford figo, Maruti 800, Tata Nano & even Autos were moving smoothly, it was only Honda which stopped. It was not only my Honda, but other Honda cars also stopped! When I was planning to buy a car, all has all options, but still, I chose Honda as it is a world renowned brand. But all in vein, I am really disappointed and my review for HONDA brand is that they are not trustworthy at all.
Honda Asked Me to Pay 1.5 Lac!
Now, these people are saying that I need to pay 1.5 lac, it means every time I will take my car in rainy season, then it will cost me 1.5 lac rupees. It is a total wastage of Rs 8 LAC. When I visited the service station for Honda Amaze Complaint, I thought that I purchased it just 2 months back and I will be given either replacement or at least engine replacement as it has been driven less than 3000 KM. But, they are asking money from me. PLEASE DON’T EVER PURCHASE ANY HONDA CAR. These were only HONDA cars that stranded, other vehicles were running smoothly.
EVEN AT SERVICE CENTER, I FOUND 10 CARS WITH SAME PROBLEM INCLUDING MOBILIO (a 7 days old purchase). I will say that do not trust this brand ever.
Honda Shattered My Trust In All Ways.

Full Review 
Exterior Exterior is ok, not up to competion.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Look below average.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine may suck water during rain due to its low air intake and compact engine room design. 100% chance of water sucking even 200mm of water on the road. Company never gurantee even 100 mm of water evading with this car. you can check with Honda on this.
Honda has programmed their milage, if you complain on your milage next sevice they can reprogam their milage according to your expectaion. They are fooling customers. 
Honda is already been pinalised for cheating and hiding information of failures and defects in their product in US. They are probably not the old Honda which is in your mind.
Ride Quality & Handling Pathertic ride quality, after 3 years of starving in sales they brought this car into the market introduced with mileage selling point but with the cost of all other features and basic things. they wanted to keep the cost low, lot of comporomise from the regular comfort of Honda cars. Companies forget their ethics and pricipels during tough times. never trust a brand. Honda is trying to do R&D on customer cost by introducing Amaze diesel engine.
Final Words Never buy any Honda car, they will offer you 10 years warranty, but they will never agree for a single manufacturing defect.They will say there is no manufacturing defect in their car. then why are they giving 5 year or 7 years warranty, just to sell and make additional money on warranty. Never fall for that. Please not Honda will never accept their mistakes and design flaws.
Areas of improvement First of of all Honda should acnowledge their customer complaints.

Full Review 
Exterior
New sporty vibrant exterior looks, boot from outside too looks elegant, windows are very well designed, bonnet though gives more of a hatchback look if looked at from sides (that's where honda saved taxes to bring it down to a compact sedan length and thus lowered the price when it initially started hurting the etios)

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
cabin space above average, seats comfy, head, leg room sufficient, missing some very basic stuff in base models like a simply vanity mirror, dashboard does lose specially in the bottom two models where the 1 DIN audio system has not been placed in the centre and gives a odd look upfront to the dashboard,  instrument panel very basic by today's standards,
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gears
Diesel engine sound is quite average and don't expect a silent engine. Fuel economy is very acceptable and infact if you are a driver who drives with sound judgement, experience and lesser use of brakes and acceleration, you can save a lot of bucks with diesel engines like this one, gears are slightly on the tougher side and could have been better
 
Ride and Handling
Easy ride with hassle free handling, nothing exceptional to expect at this budget but well and truly at par in it's segment.

Final Words
Buy it if your thinking between dezire, sail, etios and amaze. It's as simple as that, it is higher value for money than an etios, much newer and advanced than  a dezire and more vibrant and sporty than a sail if at par with everything else!
 
Areas of improvement  
The car offers you what you should get in this budget. I would say, improve you financial status and buy a City or an Accord rather than asking an amaze to improve..

Hydrostatic engine seize problem in this car not meant for driving on Indian roads in monsoon season


Full Review 
This car engine will seize in just 1 feet of water because the engine design of this car is not according to Indian roads in monsoon. 
Once your engine got seize Honda will not repair under warranty and one need to spen arout 1-2 Lac of Indian rupees to repair this car.
Hydrostatic engine lock: In this state the connectiong rods between piston and engine assembly got bend due to ingress of water in engine assembly from air intake passage of car.
Please do not buy this car Its seriously not value ofor money.
Kindly serach on internet about "Hydrostatic engine lock in HOnda Amaze" and you will found that so many customers all around the country are facing this issue in Honda Amaze car and Honda still not done anything to fix this issue from their cars permanently till now. 
Very poor experience with this car seriously worst car in its segment.
 
Hydrolock (a shorthand notation for hydrostatic lock) is an abnormal condition of any device which is designed to compress a gas by mechanically restraining it; most commonly the reciprocating internal combustion engine, the case this article refers to unless otherwise noted. Hydrolock occurs when a volume of liquid greater than the volume of the cylinder at its minimum (end of the piston's stroke) enters the cylinder. Since most common liquids are incompressible the piston cannot complete its travel; either the engine must stop rotating or a mechanical failure must occur.

I have bought amaze SMT of 05.03.14, but now i am fully embarrased on my desicison why i am not purchased Swift dzire. very light body, tyre noise irritated, etc. cant get mileage more than 18 in city without AC as i was getting 19+ from my verna in city. engine noise is one of the biggest issue with that car. built quality is too cheap as it is shame for honda. I got small dunts on its roof on heavy rain with ice pieces with that you can imagine the hardness of sheet quality.  my all driving in Chandigarh city. please please please dont go for this car, its not value for money. now there is also one more choice in market like Hyundai Xcent. Honda Amaze body and door noise really gives you feel of maruti 800. for more details you can contact me at 98761-XXXXX before you are planning to go for this scrap.

Honda cusotiomer care personal are not responding well to there clint. i had very bad expereance with amez regarding its avarege but they are not excepting. I driven car suddunly rain started my car passed through very shalow water air suction pipe sucked water because very low heigt and my car was hydrstatic locked for that i paid rs 66000 to dealers.
I never face such problem with my maruti zen and hyndai ascen in last 10 years.
Ride Quality & Handling Fair
Final Words Dont buy amez because its engine problem you have to pay around rs 70000 for repaired so dont weast your money for amez. Itsc not value for money

Full Review 
Exterior
Good overall design, Very poor quality paint job, 
 Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Ample leg room and boot, very good thighs and back support but the worst neck support from seats an additional neck support will not even stay on beacause of the seat shape, it slips off. window vibrates badly  if your window is half way down its makes you keep the A/C on even when the weather is good outside, overall a noisy atmosphere
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Powerfull engine bit more better tuning could gives better output, Good mileage, very short throw between gears
 Ride Quality & Handling
Good stearing control, really rough on bad roads smooth on good roads but 2.5 lacs Nano and 2 lacs Piaggio Ape are also good on good roads. Body roll is really bad, people on back seat will vomit if you are going long ways
Final Words
I am a NRI been using cars for around 12 years, owns this Amaze for 21 months now but ony drove around 180 days(30000 KMS).  Love to go for long journeys but Amaze is not the vehicle for it, very stiff suspension, neck support is very important when we driving longer streches, plastics already making noises from different places, metal and the overall insulation is two thin, when driving through rain feels like you are under a tin roof, with out music on engine noise is unbearable
 Areas of improvement  
Better suspension, something better to avaoid body roll, better insulation for to avoid engine noise and noise from outside.  windows needs to be worked on for more stability, neck support on any other sporty looking seats in indian cars are better so learn from that to make a seat. 
Service: if ask to fix a problem they will create another two for you

Exterior Beatiful looks, the curves on the sides just reminds us of the fluidic verna and the rear boot is just nicely attached. You never feel that it was added later. It is as if they designed the  Amaze first and then cut it to make a brio.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Huge space, Good comfort, good features.(We can buy a basic verson as well and later add the features through accesories) 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Great power, High fuel Efficiency, Smooth shift
Ride Quality & Handling Good ride quality, could have made the suspension a bit more softer, Small and zippy stearing.
Final Words It is just amazing. Just drive the car without touching the accelerator, in city conditions. The eco light in the car keeps gowing(you get the best eficiency). You can also put the fifth gear without touching the accelerator.
Areas of improvement The AC fan makes noise. Can give a 15inch wheel instead of 14.

Exterior Exterior looks good, curve, s gives sharp looks which is like Verna, so looks modern vehicle. However it do not look aggressive like CITY
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort Features are good as per model you buy; it is compact and not specious for three people at rear sit.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Petrol version will be good bet as Japanese car manufacturers are good in petrol engine technology, and this engine also not looks as smooth as FIAT diesel engine. But Diesel car will be preferred as per low running cost. With 1.5 CC Diesel engine average give 21/23 on highway will be good, and can be confirmed after 1 st service.
Ride Quality & Handling As of now ride quality and handling it seems amazing
Final Words End of the day it will really impact the Swift desire sales unless Maruti Suzuki come with modifications like Swift last year. More options in sub 4 meter deaden. This car can be value for money as it is from HONDA.
Areas of improvement Can be suggest after running 2000 to 3000 KM.

I loved the car since the first day I purchased. I was in double mind wheather to buy Amaze or Dzire but I had made a great choice.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The Space is amazing, normal sized person can fit 3 comfortably at the back seat. The dashboard same as Brio, should have been changed but it doesn't look bad because the quality used is very good.
Exterior Exterior looks beautiful, the design is well integrated and the best part is it does not look like a sub 4 meter sedan. It looks like a prper sedan.
Ride Quality & Handling Suspension is bit stiff but its a feel good factor when you are cornering or at high speed the car is planted.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Everything is perfect in this car except the clattering sound which enters the cabin when windows are closed. Wish they had better insulation for sound. But i can live with that sound because the engine performce thrills you from the word go.. The gears are smooth and perfect shifting.
Areas of improvement Sound insulation from the engine, Dashboard styling and detachable frot head rests.

Full Review 
This car is designed for people of Thaiiland or Japan. and not for Indians. The front grill has a very little HORN which is smaller than your Activa Scooter. Can you imagine using it on Indian Raods?
The front grill need redesigning. It has very large vents which allow any hard object to enter into the grill damaging Radiater. This car need a plastic Jali/ Fret Panel to use to protect the radiater.
Interior : needs lots of redesigning. I had to fix many things myself to make easy use. I can write 100s of bad things in Interior.
 Please do not buy anything that you need to hang in the car. There is no option. Also do not carry your coat with you in the car for marriage or other party. There is nothing to hang. Throw it on the seat but never put anything behind the back seat. It will come on your head if break the car suddenly.
Engine Performance is OK but my car failed one day and pulled on a truck.
This car is very bad.
I will not recommend

Hi Everyone,
This is the review i'm giving to all customer who are planning to buy Honda vehicles. My experience was with Sundaram Honda, Secunderabad.
My vehicle number: TS10BXXXXXX. I was bought a new band new Amaze 1.5 S Diesel version. With them on 1st, OCT-2014 and found some problems.
We have a compliant filed on 06th-October, 2014 and the complaint number is "1-2101-XXXXXX", we did n't get any response from the honda till 20th-Oct,2014.
The issue observed in the brand new vehicle are:1.side pulling2.Engine Sound3.Dashboard Vibration
The honda service people have taken the vehicle on 20th-Oct, 2014 and the KM reading was "699KM".
After that on 22nd-Oct,2014 the vehicle was checked by SetuRaman & Srinivas and told that everything is fine and asked me to take the vehicle.The KM meter reading was "928KM".But after checking I found the issues still persist and not at all solved.I'm not sure why company as drove it for "229 KM".After continuos calls to showroom and service people, they have taken vehicle again to the service center on 3rd-Nov,2014 the KM reading was "1007" and delivered to ussaying that issues are solved on 6th-Nov,2014 the KM reading was "1258KM".I'm not sure why company as drove it for "251 KM". And kept the vehicle 3 days.
The problem is still not solved.The important Note is that Sundaram Honda employee SRINIVAS S SalesManager has closed our compliant "1-2101-XXXXXX" though he already knew that the problem is not solved.
I'm still have all issues in papers while registration.
Ultimate information is when we mailed Honda customer service representatives(Parampreet,Gopinath) about showroom people behaviour they asked us to contact showroom people again ..:):)
Final Words I'm already in soup,so wanted to share my experience which might help new friends who are planning to buy Honda vehicles that to at Sundaram Showrooms, Secunderabad.
Areas of improvement Best to go for some other vehicle where there is respect for customers and better service.
Thanks,
Murali.

Full Review 
Hi All,
I bought Honda amaze diesel in december'13 and got to know that there was engine and diesel oil leakage first 500 km. They repaired most of the engine but refused to replace their own manufactured defective car.
They REPAIRED head gas kit, re-fixed timing plates.. All the cylinders.. Replaced the o ring and god knows what more they have done to my car.
All this was done without my consent 
Now my car has multiple issues and Honda doesn't even bother to respond back my mails.
Now. there are following issues in the car
1.Noise in front shock absorbers 
2.Horn not working
3.Left side car pull
4.have to turn steering 3-4 degree left to run the car straight
5.Breaks not effective on speed
6.Efficiency dropped from 25kmpl to 18 kmpl
7. Vibrations in engine. 2000 rpm @ 84 kmph
Trying to contact the company but not getting positive response.
All I can say is Honda is just fancy brand.. Maruti is far better.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox POOR ENGINE, NOISE IS HIGH, RPM ARE TOO HIGH, CAR ACCELERATION INCREASES BETWEEN GEAR SHIFT WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.
Ride Quality & Handling RIDE IS AVERAGE. SUSPENSION IS POOR. THE CAR TENDS TO THROW YOU AWAY FROM SEAT WHEN PASSING THRU ROUGH ROAD. THERE IS NOTHING GOOD IN AMAZE.
Final Words KINDLY DONT MAKE FOOL OF YOURSELF BY BUYING THIS CAR. I AM THE BIGGEST FOOL WHO FOLLOWED MY UNCLES ADVICE ON BUYING A HONDA CAR. HONDA CARS ARE NOW NO LONGER SAFE AND IN ORDER TO KEEP THE COST LOW, THEY ARE USING SUB-STANDARD MATERIALS.
MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE IS THAT TATA MANZA  AND DZIRE ARE MUCH BETTER CAR THAN AMAZE. I JUST TESTED A MANZA AND FOUND IT TO BE FAR BETTER THAN AMAZE IN TERMS OF INTERIORS AND RIDE HANDLING.
DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON BUYING CARS LIKE AMAZE. I MADE A MISTAKE AND I DONT WANT YOU TO REPEAT IT.

Full Review 
My Honda Amaze Diesel has done about 6500 kms. The mileage has dropped drastically from 19-20 to 15-16, on the same pattern of usage. Car has a lot of cabin noise, which other diesel cars don't have. Also, the suspension is ill designed, under capacity suspension for a diesel car. My 4 year old accent sails smoothly over potholes, while the new amaze fails to absorb any of the bumps and rattles too. Am not very happy, but since I just bought the car, I guess i'll have to live with it. Please do check other cars like ford ecosport, (even if you have a waiting period) which are priced in the same bracket. They're packed with features, which even the Honda Amaze top model does not have, and they don't have such problems like Amaze. Its worth the wait. Happy Driving.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) I have had this car for about a month. Airconditioning is excellent even at the height of Delhi summer. The quality of plastics is not as good as the City.The stereo does not accept new USB pen drives of reputed companies like HP. It only accepts older pen drives of Kingston etc. It seems to be a software problem which the dealer has not been able to fix. I would like to hear from other Honda Amaze and Brio owners if they have experienced a similar problem.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Acceleration is good at all speeds and is comparable to Honda City. Gear shifts are crisp and precise. Fuel economy, city and highways combined, is a decent 19 km/litre.Engine clatter dies down at high speeds.
Ride Quality & Handling The short turning radius is a great help in city driving. Brakes are very good, thanks to ABS.the hydraulic assisted clutch is surprisingly soft.
Final Words A decent car for middle income Indians.
Areas of improvement USB input of the stereo is faulty. Honda should recall the stereos.

Full Review 
Exterior Now when I own this car I can say "I am a Proud Owner" of HONDA AMAZE VXI. Its New style, milage, comfort & fuel economy, clearly dominates & capable to Knock out its nearest competitors like SAIL, SWIFT Dezire, Etios etc who all have contemprary looks but nothing as Cool as Honda Amaze.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Spacious Cabin with extra leg room & larger boot. Doesn't get the feel of a compact sedan while sitting inside. Three passangers accomodate comfortably at back seat. All basic & required features are available except few like No distance to empty, climate control (but AC is very effective even at 40 degrees), rain censors etc. & no innovation or changes in the DASH it is as same of BRIO. But that doesn't make any different or count while looking at the overall bundled package. Though is is not as dynamically accomplished like Fiesta & Verna but Honda's reliability & fuss-free ownership also matters.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smooth Gear shift. Though many people find the engine bit noisy however if compared with other Desiel Variants like Polo, Punto, Swift, Liva...Honda team has really done good homework to make it less noisy. One doesn't even hear the engine noise with the music system ON. Can't comment of Fuel Economy, as I am just 2 days old owner of the beauty. But I am sure it will deliver upto my expectations after 3rd service is done.
Ride Quality & Handling Smooth ride quality, excellent pick-up, under control even at 120 kmph speed. Good ground clearance. Tilt Steering & height adjustable seat makes the drive more comfortable.
Final Words "AN ALL ROUND COMPACT SEDAN" - Value for Money Car !! Happy that I booked it early in March. Will surely shift business dynamics & the market share from Maruti Suzuki to Honda in the segment. Definitely a Tough Competition & threat for the existing market players.
Areas of improvement AT is unavailable in Desiel Variant.

Exterior Eligant looks - The three lines are remarkable cool on the sides separeting this car, from all others car in the market in this segment. the front " Brio " looks are highlighted and made attractive with the steel grills and the back what to say. The master look as city... Overall this is the car for outside/ External look lovers.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interiors are again filled with lot of features all round to the booked model. Cup holders, Seat height adjustment, Leg and knee space in the back side is comfortable ( I am tall ) happy with driver seat adjustment and checked the back seat ( very comfortable ). The double horn, Steering tilt adjustment, 4 speakers, Not checked the Player, defoger, green glass ( to reduce heat on parking the vechicle in Sun ), AC is comfort and cools the cabin in 3-4 minutes, over all Good ineriors. Dash board can be ignored. With extra cost - Leg mats, Parking sensors are provided.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Car is booked - comments based on Test drive : Mild noise is observed ( Diesel Car so it is must ), Gear changing is very smooth and Fuel economy is to observed after few services. Engine performance and gear operation are like silk and just glides around. Over all the best in performance.
Ride Quality & Handling Very smooth and silky. as mentioned. It glides around.
Final Words Best Car to be owned at that price " Best value for our money ".
Areas of improvement Could have increased the features like blue tooth connection, Reverse parking sensors, Navigation etc. Change the DASH BOARD in the car.

According to me it has similiar sound which emits from other diesel cars. Good fuel economy of 19.3km per litre. slick and short gears!!
Ride Quality & Handling Smooth Ride with excellent handling!! Moves the way you want!! Lots of power!! WOULD SAY A DRIVER'S CAR!!
Final Words An excellent car driven after a long time in this range!! Will be the BEST SELLER in NO TIME!!
Areas of improvement Front panel quality, Music system with blue tooth, reverse sensor and GPS is a must for TOP END models.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) It has not got CD player or MP3 player. It has only Radio and USB connection which is very basic and Interior only has space which is useful features. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I was driving in rain and it stop where other cars like Santro / Accent / Maruti are running well with same depth of water logged area. also , Engine got water inside and caused me problem where other car were past same area without difficulty.
Ride Quality & Handling
Final Words I must look in to it to make it perfect for indian enviornment. I would not prefer this car in Indian rainy climate.
Areas of improvement Dash board, Honda Need to reduce the diesel engine noise, Clutch is hard - driving in city traffic jam will be painful, Need to improve in Ground clearance.
My Overall Experience on Honda Amaze is good. But the car delivery waiting period for Diesel S Variant  3-4 months and for V variant the waiting Period is nearly 5 months in Hyderabad(India).

Full Review 
Exterior
 Decent looks however no provision for installing fog lights in the base model. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Too many faults in the interiors. Horn sounds like a scooter horn (very low), improper placement of ac vents which results in little cooling in the back. Side view mirrors in the base model can only be adjusted manually from the outside. No automatic or internal adjustment provided. Reminded me of my old maruti 800. This point was not mentioned by sales people at the showroom. No socket provision provided to add mobile charger as an accessory in base model. Power windows button not illuminated making it difficult to see the buttons at night. No dead pedal provided. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine is the only saving grace. Although a bit noisy, it packs a good punch especially diesel one. Fuel economy is good. Gives 20 kmpl on the highway. Gearbox is Responsive. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Decent ride quality. However 3 people cannot sit comfortably in the back due to less cabin space. 
Final Words
 Spending close to 7.5lacs on diesel base version is not worth it due to many lack of features. Plus Honda after sales service is below average compared to maruti. & reason buying base model was the stereo system which is provided by HONDA doesn't have CD  player + no Bluetooth + no inbuild USB , thus no use of buying higher  ver. 
Areas of improvement  
 All the points mentioned above.

Comfort to sit on back, OK with front (means owners car, not for drivers). Great cabin space under 4m Sedan, Well enough boot space. Without trouble 6ft can sit in front or back row. More than its competitor giving. Low cost interiors, Low cost ICE, No power socket

 Good,excellent
Ride Quality & Handling
I brought the car just 10 days back and found excellent.Very much comfartable to ride in city as well as highways. Nice to drive in low as well as high speed.As of now ride quality and handling it seems amazing

Areas of improvement 2nd and 3rd gear noise little bit.But I am happy to ignore it and enjoy still.
Suggestions and Views:
No car can provide all in one specs and features.But this time honda have tried its best according to Indian mentality people.This car will set new benchmarks like swift and Dzire.Even maruti have started to offer discount on DZire after this launch of amaze.So its no worry car for atleast 7 to 10 years.People who says this amaze have this have not this.Then its not ok in my opinion.in 7 lakhs diesel sedan should be whatever then its amaze only.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Shocking and dissapointing experience with amaze. Ever since I bought this car within 1000 Km the car pick up drastically reduced, when I brought this to the service center's notice, they said the oil pipe need to be replaced, was really shocked to know how can a brand new car develop such a technical problem. The authorities returned the car after the replacement and said all is fine,  But to my surprise after that when one day I took the vehicle for a long drive and went out of station, the car was not going beyond 40 km. Faced serious trouble with it especially in a ghat section. Now once again I have given the car for service. Engineers are attending to it. They too are puzzled. My fight will be on until the Honda company replace this car if not I am ready to take the legal route until I get justice.

The fuel economy of top variant diesel (1.5 VXMT i-DTEC) after running 5111 km and second service remains at 13/14 KMPL in mumbai city and 15/16 KMPL on highway (Mumbai-Pune Express way), much below claimed or projected figure of 25 KMPL and declaration of being the best fuel economy car in India. Service supervisor assured that fuel economy will get better after the 2nd service which was carried out after 5000 km. However, i have not experience any improvement, so far. It is highly disappointing. Is it an isolated case or are there other user with such experinces?.

Full Review 
I bought my Honda Amaze from Whitefield Honda in Bangalore. I chose this car for easy city driving and mileage. But this turned out to be the worst decision I ever made. Its just 6 weeks since I purchased this car - I was in the traffic one day and all of a sudden smoke started coming out of the bonnet. I called the Honda service and they came and took the car to their service center (Whitefield Honda). They checked the vehicle and told me that the problem was with the clutch and I have to replace it. As the warranty does not cover the clutch problem - I  had to pay Rs.9,500/- to get the vehicle done. 
 
The biggest disaster is that when they returned the vehicle, there were plenty of scratches on the front bumper which occurred while the vehicle was being towed to the service center. On asking the service staff - they told me that nothing can be done about it and they didn't even care to do anything about it. I'm very disappointed with the way the staff dealt the whole problem and would never recommend this car or the dealer to anyone. A polo or a Swift Dzire is always a better option.

Full Review 
Exterior: Simply superb for the price, liked rear parking lamps very much, exterior design is 1 step up than the competition. the side profile and front too looks very nice. I have purchased red beauty SMT iDTEC. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Seat comfort for short drive less than 100Km is good. If you drive for 200km or so you will feel there’s a pain in your back. Use pillow in front seat back to have a lumbar support comfort. Rear seat is superb. Space management is phenomenal as it’s a sub 4 meter. Wanted to book Ecosport but rejected it once I saw a pathetic interior of Ecosport and went ahead for Amaze. Features for the price such as ABS, EBD, EPS , Buttons on steering wheel are quite good !Front seat height is good for me 5,10 height. Integrated Head restraint not required then.Only this which was missing was Airbags which came now in SX version!
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: I found the NVH level in Amaze is better or equal to competition like Suzuki Desire and others. About mileage I am getting 24.5 if along driving car for 200km. If fully loaded getting 20+ mileage.  
Ride Quality & Handling:  Handling on Indian roads is quite good. Breaks are pretty good. ABS+EBD makes is more more safe!
 Final Words: Just go for it as its 3 lac cheaper than sibling Honda City, Same engine 100PS is more than enough for city driving. Beats Ecosport in engine department! Mileage is superb! Once I have reached magic figure of 25.5kmpl on 100km drive!
 Areas of improvement  :only changes required in Instrument cluster! I am automotive engineer working for leading automotive company is the world(other than Honda)!

Amaze has got one of the biggest con in features.
It is the AC.
Whenever I swithc on the AC, a very foul smell starts coming. It stays for abouty a minute and then vanishes.
But these initial seconds make you restless and make you rethink" Have I wasted lakhs to smell this shit".
Other point is the efficiency of the AC.
In winter it feels OK but during summer, in places like gujarat, the car struggles to perform in the noon.
The mileage as quoted by the company is only under test conditions.
If you have a normal drive in the city with AC running, it would be around 17-18 which is same as a dzire or sail.
Boot space is not an issue. Its quite good.
One more con is the non adjustable head rest in the front and rear seats. It should be made available atleast as an upgrade option.

STOCK TYRES AND RIMS ARE BULLSHIT (14 INCH+175). FRONT LOOKS TOO SIMILAR TO BRIO. SHOULD GET BETTER HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY..
STOCK HEADLIGHTS ARE DULL. PISS POOR COLOR CHOICES BRIO has more colors. NO BLOODY REVERSE SENSORS?? WTF HONDA?
Horn sucks as well.
I HIT A FUCKING DOG (walked away unscathed.)ON THE ROAD SLIGHTLY ONLY AND IT BROKE MY STUPID AC CONDENSER....!!!! COSTS ABOUT 18000. BUT INSURANCE. PHEW!

Door guard/side guard/ bumper guard. everything protective.
The 15 inch alloys and up-size tires with nitrogen should take care of ground clearance issues.
Already excellent suspension becomes mind blowing, increases wheel track and reduces wobbling and gives better cornering still. nitro ensures mileage is not affected, mod the looks a bit. angel eyes. extra fittings. etc.
Change headlight power cable and level up to stronger lamps, get a better sounding dual horn, interior wooden trims etc. AAAAaaannnddd... you will be all set to go!!

Full Review 
The design of Honda Amaze at the lower part of Bumper is very poor. Wherever I am seeing the amaze car (including my car) am seeing so many rough scratches on that area. The design at that place is not suitable for indian road conditions.
Next, the shield provided at the lower part of the engine is fixed with body by buttons. Since there is only 5 buttons at the front side, it is very easily removing due to indian road conditions. No other top brand cars are having button like fixtures there. It was unpinned in my car. when i went to honda showroom in tirunelveli, they said to replace the whole engine shield. Its cost is about Rs. 4500. Just for the damage of 4 plastic pins why should we replace the whole shield.
Also, the car body above the rear wheels is easily gets scractes , it can be modified. otherwise the performance is good.

Exterior Excellent exterior aero design for better speed and mileage.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Power windows performs good. Power Steering is good. It is very comfortable for travelling long drives continously ( I felt it  for 600kms above ) and continued with the day work without any tired. Very good cabin space and leg rooms kids would love to travel on this comfort. Good boot space on it's class.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance id good. Pickup is good. Mileage is excellent. I drove 600 Kms + with diesel filled for Rs.1500 and there was balance of fuel for Rs.200 and above, I really wonder about the mileage  ( As fuel price in Chennai is Rs.47.28 on 20.12.2015).
Ride Quality & Handling Easy handling. It will be more convenient for female drivers and newly trained teenagers.
Final Words Amazing performance with amazing mileage.
Areas of improvement Ground clearance is less as comfort is more but Honda engineers  can work on this. Engine sound on cabin is comparatively little more can reduce coz it's Honda...!!!

Full Review 
Booked the car before launch, Onwer for last two years, 25000 plus in two years, satisfied with the engine and vehicle performance, enjoyed driving 600 km from dalhousie to delhi in a single day withourt any tiredness.
Only at times fells the intial fater pick up isues otherwise the Honda Engineering is great. At times feels the engine noise but against economy bearable. No maintenance issues, good space, good boot space, an enjoyable daily companion.
At hilly terrain never felt that the car is low floored, was able to monevour even from uneven and broken roads withourt touching the car floor. At low spped sometimes the road feel is there but at high spped there is total comfort.
The head light needs to be brightened as during rainny season I flet a difficulty at night. In two years the only difficulty I have felt is in the locks.  the driver lock is getting a little dizzy and is not as smooth as earlier. The key sometimes does not moves smoothly.
The tyre and the jack nees to be fixed so that in cae the car jumps they do not jump, the inner of the dicky also needs some make over or covering. My view overall is positive for the car.

Full Review 
Exterior
 Exterior styling is very good, the lines on the cars make it feel like premium, it does not make the car look like making sedan to fit in hatchback liek suzuki swift desire.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 It lakes interior features as it is very basic, no styling like ford or hyundai. Space is very good, and when the car was launch it was best in is class.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine performance can not be matched for this car when the car was launched, now ford has launched the same engine with same power, same fuel economy (its odd that how can these 2 engines be similar). Fuel economy with my drive of 90 kms daily 50 kms on highway and 40 kmns in city it gives around 23 kmpl and i am very satisfied with the fuel economy with my driving style,. Gearbox makes lil noise like when being shifted, may be thats with all the honda cars (P.S. My first honda car and that too diesel).
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is quite good, it absorbs potholes quite good on high speeds although back passengers feel the bumps. You can not fit average sized 3 member on the back seat like you can have that in swift (Owner of swift diesel 2009 model also). Handling is accurate and the steerig reacts very quickly, although the car has very hard tires, handling may improve with better tires
Final Words
 I bought my car in 2013 and it has completed 40,000 kms. Service costs amount to Rs. 4,000 (average) and only one part changed since then, brake pads. Car is still performing very well and ya there is cabin noise and the vibrations in the car, but noise can be composated with the car stereo system and generally we travel with our stereos switched on in car. 
 
The main reason I bought Amaze is the Honda Badge comes with it and yes the service centre of honda is very good, they listen to you and respond to it accordingly. The parts cost is higher than its rivals like Maruti but the cost is recovered in the life of the parts and frequency of change of oils and water. For eg. Swift's coolant changes on every 20,000 kms while the amaze's change near 1,00,000. Please ask comparison sheet from all the dealers of the cars in this segment and I am sure you will find Honds's and Toyota's are the cheapest to own.
Areas of improvement  
 Cabin noise can be reduced by better insualtion. I have heard there is a hydrolock problem in the car, which can be avoided by placing intake higher like in swift. Better tires shall be proivided also the fifth wheel shall be alloy also. They is huge scope of improving the interior of the car and in my opiniom the exterior requires only ome improvement, the day light led and the projector headlamps. People may extra 50,000 bucks to buy honda with improved interior and exterior.

Exterior Most stylish look than any other car in this segment and for this price.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good quality plastics, doors boot the smoothness of closing is not seen in any other car of this segment.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine response is slow, but powerful mostly no need to shift to lower gears on uphill, highway average of 25-28 Kmpl and City 14-16 Kmpl this low city average may be due to the auto throttling as the feature of engine.
Gear box bit tight compared to other vehicles I used.
Ride Quality & Handling Good breaking with ABS, Good stearability, The door rear view mirrors are very costly but will get damaged by a small hit by hands of motorcyclist, It positioning is blocking the vision while making turnings especially if you sit a bit back from the steering. Very comfortable for long drives. I use it for very long drives. Engine sound and vibration is much less than other vehicle in this segment. Availability of small spare parts is a serious issue throughout the service centers in India as I experienced it personally, Services are costly if your use is less than 10000 KM per year as 6 monthly service or 10000KM service recommended and a service cost approximately INR 6000/-
Final Words Value for money confortable and very reliable car recommend this if you do 20000KM a year.
Areas of improvement Rear view mirrors hinges to be made strong and mirror has to go backward without damaging the assembly.

Ride Quality is ok & Handling is ok.
Final Words 6 month back I bought amaze (D) due to poor quality materials used in the car  & very poor experience with dealer, within 6 months viper is not working properly, I thought of selling this car (7000 running car) company says 30% depreciation no resale value. If you see news paper add company is advertising about resale value its all fake. Look for Hyundai cars I had used for 10 years I just compared with my santro & Hyundai service.
Areas of improvement Totally unhappy no words. Dont go by lookwise /brand wise its old honda please take long testdrive with any selfdrive cars you will come to no what exact it is.
All this i am comparing with last 10 years of experience with Hyundai.

Full Review 
Exterior Great looks. In my view, still remains the best looking sub-4m sedan out there.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Lots of space, both in front and rear...the boot space is also quite good for a decent weeekend travel. Features list is no doubt limited as compared to competition...but its adequate for a normal joe. Nevertheless, Honda definitely should look to improve its equipment and features level.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent with no turbo lag whatsoever. Effortless to drive in city conditions and gives more than decent performance on the highways. Mileage as discussed in many other reviews is great. For driving till speeds of 90-110, it will give a great mileage...only in speeds more than that, the mileage starts to drop swiftly. In city drives, due to high torque and no turbo lag, mileage of more than 20 can be easily achieved.
Ride Quality & Handling Decent, although the suspension could have been a little softer. Handling is good with EPS weighing properly as the speed progresses. 
Final Words Overall experience of the car has been amazing. I have done around 27k Kms with the car now in around 17 months. No major breakdowns, though minor rattles are there, the same have been manageable to a large extent. The car has been used primarily for my daily travel to office (around 70kms to and fro) with occasional highway trips on expressways, NHs, SHs, local roads, no roads, etc.When i purchased the car, the only option in the competition was dzire...which was outrightly rejected due to its design and looks. If given an option now, i would probably have chosen amaze again over  xcent (due to its poor engine (diesel) and driving dynamics) and zest with the infamous TATA after sales service.
No doubt the company needs to improve on its build quality, engine NVH levels, lack of features, but still being the best looker of the segment (IMHO), presence of ABS (from base model), decent driving dynamics (better than xcent for sure), better brakes (as compared to dzire especially and xcent also (suddent bite problem)) and with proven performance and mileage of its engine, amaze remains the best choice in this segment for diesel.  
In petrol, i cant comment much as i have not used it, but without the ABS in its base models, and with the engine similar as the competition, i think xcent provides a better option with more features at lesser price. 
Areas of improvement Engine NVH levels, and also provide more equipments and features which are being offered by competition.

 Amaze looks wonderful with cuts and curves
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Features are good but there should me airbag in the lower models as well taking into consideration the safety of the people using it. Its very spacious and comfortable for long drive as well. Also HOnda could think of new feature like the car unable to start until and unless the driver puts on the seat belt.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Excellent fuel economy. Believe me when I drove all the way to Nainital from Delhi it gave me a mileage of 27.5 till Rampur which is even more than what has been claimed by the company. A very responsive gearbox whithout any sound but slightly unhappy with the noise of the engine which is even more noisy than verna.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality and handling is excellent. People buying i20 or polo or swift Dzire or Sail or Xcent, please go for Amaze. Its an excellent deal.
Final Words
 Its Just Awesome.
Areas of improvement  
 Sound of the Engine got to be improved.

I have paid full amt. of roadside assistance,first time in 8 months I asked for assistance & they dissapointed me.
They talked to me as if I was asking for something I didn't pay for. The engine's sound should not be felt inside the cabin. The dashboard gives a feel of two decade old car. it should be like what Honda is known for.

Full Review 
I bought my the Black S iDTEC back in May 14. I have to say performance wise and mileage has given me smiles. I have clocked as of date 7500 kms with 19-20 kms per litre in the highway (with AC) and 14-15 in the city. Anyways there is a issue of Wheel Freeze or hydrolocking issue if you drive over shallow waterlogged roads at speeds above 120kms. I have driven over the same at 150kms (thats the max it can go) more than 20-30 times over the past months in the Bangalore Salem highway. There is no issue when driving in rains. It is as smooth as the cadbury chocolate. I have tested the speeds at which it happens and below 120kms the car is smooth when you drive over the hallow waterlogged roads. Else the Driver needs to be vigilant or you could loose control. Be very careful. Else no other flaw i could come accross. Its a ok car + good performance + decent mileage at the price they are selling.

Great exterior looks by giving cuts and lines all over the body. Head and tail lights looks great. Ground clearance is also good as compared to CITY and other sedan models of Honda.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Could have given better sound system with phone connectivity and better interior. Its gud that Multiple cup/bottle holders have been provided. Climate control provision should have been provided.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Very good fuel economy (20 KMPL in city and 25 KMPL on highways). However engine power is slightly less. Gearbox is also very smooth.
 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Very smooth to handle. Options like seat height adjustment, stearing height adjustment makes it more comfortable. ABS makes you feel more comfortable especially when you drive on highways.
 
Final Words
 All in all amaze is amazing as far as looks, fuel economy is concerned. Investing money is Amaze is really worth. Experiencing Honda for the first time but for me it’s better than other Automobile companies of the same class.

Full Review 
Exterior
The exterior of the car is good enough and it looks like a proper car when we compare it with some of the offerings from rivals like MS
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
For Driver: 1) the steering position is good. 2) the driver seat is not at all comfortable for a taller person. The front seats are smaller and they lack proper under thigh support. The rear seats are comfortable and there is enough leg room. The air conditioner is excellent. The music system is adequate
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
I have driven the car for almost 11000 Kms and the best and the worst feature of the car relate to the engine. first the best feature and that is the fuel economy. If I drive the car on highways and at a constant speed of 60 - 65 km, i get an astonishing FE of 29 KMPL. In normal city drive the car retuns a FE of anywhere 23-24KMPL
I drive for almost 80 -90 Kms per day and the emi of the car is offset against the savings on the fuel cost.
Now the worst feature and that is the engine noise and vibrations. I feel the engine noise is more than you could ask for. When you switch off the engine, it reminds me of an ambassodor which used to stop with a thud.
Ride Quality & Handling
The handling of the car is excellent with a very light steering but the the ride quality is not as good as honda city. The suspension of the car is on the harder side and you can feelthe bumps and jerks on Indian roads.
 
Final Words
If you are driving on long routes and FE is your main concern then look no further and buy this car

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Superb space in a compact sedan. Very comfortable car. Dashboard good looking  has most of the useful features built in.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent engine - ignore the engine noise then its the best available diesel engine in market today. Its pickup/mileage/driveability is best in all segments , equally suited for city driving, highways, hilly areas. I am getting close to 23.9- 24.2 kpl in highway driving with 100% AC on. at 75- 80 km/hr.
Ride Quality & Handling Amazing, full of comfort &  excellent so far at high speed the car is planted.
Final Words Everything is perfect in this car, the engine performce thrills you from the word go.. The gears are smooth and perfect shifting.
Areas of improvement  Sound insulation from the engine side.Front look like Brio,ground clearance,No GPS & blue tooth connectivity.

Exterior:  Very good looking, very compact. Honda's policy of max space has worked wonders while desigining Amaze.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Marvalous engineering of space, good comfortable seats, Leg space as good as a premium car. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Pepy engine - would say driver's car, wonderful ecomony in city we are getting 19+ per litre 11000kms done already. Long drive we should get atleast 22+ with AC on.
Slick and short gear box does wonders
Ride Quality & Handling: Execelent handling, and good road behaviour. Very good in sharp turns. Honda has done an excellent job
Final Words: A wonderful compact car with all features!! Can say a perfect car!! We were looking at Rapid / Vento and D'zire. but when we saw this car we just flipped at the way this car was made. the strong diesel eng, interior spacing, boot space made us go for this car!! Also Hallmark Honda Navi Mumbai (from whom we bought the car) has till date given a wonderful service!! 
Areas of improvement: Honda has to work on insulation of outside sound!!

I recently took the Honda Amaze Deiesl 1.5 S. And have driven 1000 Kms , 500 Kms in city and 500 kms on the highway. I truely enjoy the car, I love the car , ride quality is amazing and thanks to Honda Engineers. I have been using Tata Manza , Swift previously and owned a Fiesta before and father owns a Skoda laura. So I have been driving different diesel engines so far. But Honda's First diesel engine is amazing. comparing to the price and the quality i could firmly say Honda is the best car in the segment and above.
I see lot of compaints about the Engine noise. May be honda had this before or during the booking period. Now it is very silent than the fiat 1.3 or renault engines. To truely say i get the same refined feeling that i get in the Sokda Engines.
Exterior I have a Blue Amaze . Exterior is really good for the size and better than the competitiors.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) I wonder how Honda is able to provide such a space inside the car and the boot for 4m size car. Boot can easily fit 5 normal size suite cases.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Pick with 100 bhp is. is better than all competitors.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling and ride quality is very good. I did drive up to 120 kmph. Fiat engine goes to 140, 150 easily i doubt honda would do that.
Final Words I would say the best car in its segment and above.
Areas of improvement Engine start , stop vibration needs to be reduced. Deffogger should be added to all  models.

Full Review 
Exterior: The look of car is really very good. It looks trendy.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): The space in the rear is an issue. It can accomidate 2 adults and a kid comfortabally. But, if you try to make 3 adults sit, its not good. Although its ok when going a short distence, but gets really very uncomfortable for long distence. But the front row is spacious and comfortable.
The features are good. The finish and look  has got  honda City's (Second Genaration) feel. Overall it good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Let me clarify here that, the engine is not at all noisy. The cabin is also very much noise proof. I drove it for 450 K.M Staight, but did not feel any noise or vibration. And the gear box is smooth like butter.
The fuel economy is also good. It gave me a milage of 21 K.M Per liter with A/C, which is actually good for my kind of driving.
Ride Quality & Handling: As I have already stated, the ride quality is an issue in the real row. The Suspensions are really hard. So, hard that I felt like sitting in a Fiat Premier Padmini.  You can actually feel each and every hump and jurks on he road. So, my humble request to Honda people is to make the suspension a bit softer, actually a lot softer.
The handling is awsome. I drove it on plain roads, rough roads, hilly roads, in rain, everywhere it passed with flying colours.
Final Words: Don't think much, if you are planning to buy it, thewn just go for it.
Areas of improvement : Definately, the suspensions at the rear.

Exterior is good  enough.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Is satsfactory.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Unbearable cabin sound is the only concern for which  I hav to go for other car where I hav to pay more for fuel.
U have to compramise with uncomfrrtsble sond if u r going for this car. the sound gives feeling of driving Tata indica 2001. I pesonally want to hav that feeling again. Even Indica improved alot. Hope hoda will do the same.
Ride Quality & Handling Clutch is hard (harder then my indica 2006 which is now khatara) , gear shifting is tolrable. May be I am expecting more from honda but for honda and me it is not up to the mark.
Final Words If u r not perchesing alto in petrol and indica in diesel it means u want style, luxery, ccomfort and safety. Sefty is there in this car but piece of mind naaaaaaa...
I m middle class person my daily running is aroun60-70 km I tried a lot to compromise with its sound . So I called test drive 2nd time 1st time I took in city and 2nd time in city as well as on expressway . It is having the noise at 40 as well as on 135 kmph. So I rejected the car and booked other diesel car.
It is as simple as having a very beautyfull zero figure wife who keep on shouting in fact barking every time when u enter home.
I dont need that kind of wife.
Areas of improvement Noise.

Exterior Nice, very compact look (ok, below four meters car) with sporty curves, nice taillamps.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort ) Poor dashboard (three tone &three separate meters as in bike not good) ,no automatic climate control, basic switches on dashboard,space & comfort  was good,nice boot.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Peppy engine with nice pickup, very good mileage (IDTEC team,done nice job) & nice gearbox (colour should be changed).
Ride Quality & Handling Good, cabin should be more insulated.
Final Words Nice honda car, peppy engine with 24kmpl mileage with poor interiors
Areas of improvement Toomuch waiting period (paid advance on 5th april, got delivery on19th july),interiors,(dash colour should be either black & beige or beige & brown), gearknob colour,some noise from fan, fog lights should be led day light lamps like i20(VXMT should be more than a premium hatch), automatic climate control, parking sensors, rear ac vents, telescopic steering & sunroof should be given with some premium. SPARE wheel SHOULD BE AN ALLOY WHEEL.

Exterior Car look stylish from outside, especially with it's nice looking boot. The new Blue and Red color options are add on to the looks.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Though it's similar to Brio, the interiors look good and no nonsense.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Power, pickup and easy to drive engine with minimum gear changes. However, I found it a bit noisy which I did not expect from Honda and slight vibrations at the pedals when you rev it up. It's too early to mention about the fuel economy, however Honda are claming 25+ and I would be more than happy if I get 22+ on an average.
Ride Quality & Handling Excelent car in this segment to drive as well as chauffeur driven... Quality is good.
Final Words Amaze does Amazes me and just hoping that the maintenance and fuel cost to be minimal.
Areas of improvement As of now i would say, Engine Noise and Vibration is something where Honda has to work on.
Hope this was helpful

THe musculine & curvy look makes it ahead of all the sedans in the segment. Best in class interiors with elegance & confort.
The first diesel engine with the maximum power 106HP & mileage 25.08 has given the strong feagures to conquor the market.  We believe HONDA to prove to the figures
I-DTEC will prove out to be the best. I have a linea & Yet to take the drive for the AMAZE but feels will be astonosing.
The Amaze is a testimony to Honda’s ‘Man Maximum, Machine Minimum’ principle that believes in maximizing space for you and minimizing space taken up by the machinery. With Best in Class cabin space & so much attention paid to your comfort, you will be amazed at how Amaze changes your life.
The rear of this car has been specifically designed to accommodate your every need while traveling. The 400 liter boot space provides you with the comfort of knowing that everything you want is always with you.
Final Words Diesel Icon in small Sedan section with Great Style & mileage & interiors
REALLY AMAZE ING.

Full Review 
Exterior The style of Amaze is very new and  stylish. I liked the looks streched Brio  
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Is more spacious from inside and the dashboard is neatly arranged. Good family car to drive in the city and highways.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The fuel economy what company have listed will be a variations for the Indian driving conditions., Engine takes time to warm up and to get the required power takes time, the gear shift was little stiff initiallly in second and third gear .
Ride Quality & Handling Ride is good on handling the cornering of the vehicle is not up to the mark what I was expecting from Honda.
Final Words Good Spacious Family car for city driving, but cannot take to long drives on mountains terrains . Good work done by Honda but Honda design Team should have made changes in facelift insted of just make Brio into a Sedan.
Areas of improvement I don't think any change is needed only thing they have worked on ground clearence as most of speed breaker/Potholes it might hit the bottom.

Exterior I have a swift dzire ZDI 2013 model as well but this one is a winner in all aspects it has an attractive fluidic design the rear portion of the car looks amazing just like its name.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Superb. could have been better if driver armrest would be provided.the trunk is 400 litres big which is a huge one compared to the one of maruti suzuki swift dzire which is just 315 litre.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Powerful, fuel economy of 23+ but a bit hard gearbox even the basic model of diesel  in this car has ABS which is amazing at such less price point.
Ride Quality & Handling As smooth as silk in handling it is very comfortable while driving the driver does not feels tired even after riding 100 kms continuously.
Final Words A must buy for honda lovers and a much better alternative than maruti suzuki swift dzire. no doubt of honda's quality and brand image a complete small family car.
Areas of improvement No much improvement required.

Full Review 
Exterior Looks like old 3rd generation honda city. Boot is added nicely to hatchback. From front view looks like B2 class hatchback. From side view & quarter view looks like proper sedan wheelbase is less, so turning is not a problem even in small lanes & conjusted parking. Power exterior mirror folding, first time in class.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Unconvensional dashboard for this class. Seats not comfirtable when comapred to dzire, sail or manza, Cabin has great space.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Even it has 100 BHP, it doesnt rev too much like DDIS engine. So dont expect it to go beyong 160-165 KM/H. Fuel economy is great for disel.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling is OK, but having fun like dzire. City dirving is easy. Ride quality is littel bit bumpy on pot holes.
Final Words A great car from Honda which could see more improvement on comfort, interior styling & more features on high end varient. 
Areas of improvement Seating comfort, Interior styling, New dashboard, more features like full MID, folding rear seat, automatic climate control, rear fog lamp. Seat belt height adjustment, adjustable head restraints at least on top variant.

Just wanted others to know that after I have deposited the money..HONDa put the price up by 15000rs and said that untill I get the car, I have have to pay whatever the price difference is and the waiting time is 1 month in gujarat. I mean new entry in diesel and they let other take and advantage with this silly things.
I heard about engine as they are new in diesel version. I am going to buy honda now but they will have one VERY UNHAPPY AND NOT SATISFIED customer.
This is very competative market and other brands always looking for your faults and they had 2 to 3 now. I think chevrolet sail would have been better option with this new HONDA AMAZE DIESEL.
New buyers, be clear what you buying. I havent driven it yet but already unsatisfied. They gave me the wrong leaflet at the first place with wrong colour option in 2nd diesel category so I have to go for 3rd one later which cost me more just coz of color.
Brand value is there, I saw interior quite nice, excellent fuel economy and 1.5 powerfull engine.

Full Review 
Exterior Appealing exteriors especially Rear.Honda Cars always look best,All colour options not available in Base models i.e. EMT and EXMT.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very similar to Honda Brio., But better than other cars, Space is quite enough for Rear passengers, Good Leg and Knee Room., Comfort is quite OK.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good Pick up. Somewhat engine noise is there but it is acceptable, as Volkswagen Polo and Dzire are more noisy. and after all all diesl engines make noise but issue can be set aside, if  user wants fuel economy. Fuel economy can be judged only after 2-3 service intervals. Gear shifting is much smooth and hence no problem in this respect. Overall Value for money.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is best. Easy maneauverability and Good control on vehicle.
Final Words A very good introduction of Honda in diesel segment. Generates healthy competition among other manufacturers. A true Hindi saying " Der Aaye  Durust Aaye"
Areas of improvement Ground Clearance must be increased upto 170mm atleast, Dual Horn must be given in Base Models also. AC Fan noise must be reduced, All Colour Options must be made available in Base Models.

Ride Quality & Handling Riding was good but with front seat non-detachable..it was uneasy..it will effect long drives.
Final Words I already booked it, but still not sure of taking it due to no side mirror indicator. Even small cars have this option now, but going for SMT without this is something considerable.
Areas of improvement Mainly side mirror indicators for SMT. VXMT already have this option, but it is recommended for SMT aswell.also front seat should be detachable. My old small car have these options. Exteriors do make lot of changes. not bad.

Exterior Compartively  good in its segment especially as compare to dezire. Amaze doesn't look trimmed from back or stretched from brio.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space and Comfort is more than acceptable, with loaded features even in its base model makes it outstanding from its rivals.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Aluminium engine is a little noisy however you won't feel it in cabin while running with AC on. Currelty giving me 22 Kmpl in diesel at a lower running of 750 km in 21 days. Expecting it to cross 24 kmpl atleast after 01st service.. Gearbox is also quite smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling Superior on road grip and best in class handling. you won't feel anytime that you are lossing your horse.
Final Words Go for it. Honda have always brought goods when it meets quality. Not a product comes out of rat race.
Areas of improvement Noise of engine can be brought down. Mud Guards, wheels covers should come in all segment.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Dash board is not so appealing and seperate head rests would have been better, Legroom is too good for this model as you can stretch full legs at the rear seats. Door handle bars hard to open and rear boot lid is little hard to lock..needs little more pressure.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gear Fuel economy seems to be good. giving 20km/l now. we will see in long run how much it gives. Turbo is very good in 2nd and 3rd gear, no need to press accelerater..it will drive itself. Gear box is very soft and gear shifting is perfect
Ride Quality & Handling Ride and handling quality is excellent. ABS is good. Engine is little noisy as compared to Swift dzire.
Final Words Very good car at reasonable price.
Areas of improvement Horn sounds like scooter horn, head rest could have been made seperate, door handle bars hard to open..Honda should have launched Automatic verison in Diesel also. I was waiting for that, but anyway manual is also good.

Ride Quality & Handling Handling is good but the suspension is little stiff. it corners well four people can comfortably sit. Fith passesnger will have to squeeze in
Final Words Buy it.
Areas of improvement Make the front grill wider. Should have more colour options. Mag wheels should be standard.
Verdict- Looks and rides better than all it's competitor. Etios and Swift dezire will have a tough competition.  it is very smartly priced too.

Areas of improvement ENGINE NOISE INSIDE THE CABIN IS ON HIGHER SIDE. NEEDS TO WORK ON THIS ASPECT. REST OF THE CAR IS A CLEAR WINNER IN ITS CLASS.

Honda has finally entered the diesel vehicle segment in the country with the launch of the compact sedan Amaze. Launched in both petrol and diesel variants, the Honda Amaze aims to be the first real challenge for Maruti Suzuki's Swift DZire.The lowest petrol variant of the Honda Amaze is priced at Rs. 4.99 lakh, while the top two variants, both automatics, will cost Rs. 6.62 lakh and Rs. 7.5 lakh. The base diesel variant is priced at Rs. 5.99 lakh, while the top-end one costs Rs. 7.6 lakh.The diesel variant sports a 1.5 i-DTEC engine, developed specially for the Indian market, and has a fuel efficiency of 25.8 km per litre, according to the company. It has been derived from Honda's 1.6 i-DTEC which sells in Europe. The same engine will subsequently be used in next generation models of the City, Jazz and Brio starting next year.The petrol model has the same 1.2-litre i-VTEC engine as the Brio and the Jazz, and will have fuel efficiency of 18 km/litre, the company says. The automatic variants will run 15.5 km per litre of fuel."The Amaze is our most strategic model in the Indian market and has been developed with strong focus on Indian requirements," Honda Motor Co. managing officer Yoshiyuki Matsumoto said at the launch.

Exterior
 Better than any other car in this segment
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Awesome space with comfort quality, a few more features would have surely added the zeal
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine is chiurning out more power than the aluminium housing can handle, probably thats the reason for noise, but overall gearshift and power are absolutely undoubtably the best. Fuel economy sure needs to improve a lot, driven close to about 3000+ kms, around 1000 km on highway, which returned a fuel economy of around 22, but in city, it fails to even reach the 17kmpl mark, on an average it reaches 14-15 only, so pretty disappointed with that.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Honda doesn't lets you down
Final Words
 Overall i'm satisfied, but lets see if the service team can work something up for me after the second service as they promise that the average would certainly improve after that.
Areas of improvement  
 Fuel economy, engine noise, door handle quality, music system.

Exterior
 Very nice looks . headlamps could have been more stylish
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Very comfortable. After driving the honda city for 9 years we have no complaints as the cabin space is very good in the front and the rear with a very good boot space  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Good, powerful engine but noisy on the inside , fuel economy in city with full AC and delhi peak hour traffic is 18.5 Kmpl. Gearbox is smooth , the gear shift could have better shifts as car literally jumps in the second gear. The clutch is super smooth 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Is good with a responsive steering 
Final Words
 Very good car for city driving. Have not been able to drive it on a highway as yet.
Areas of improvement  
 Engine noise inside cabin needs to be checked as sometimes it is annoying. The Bluetooth connectivity is missing. An automatic diesel option would be lovely for the city folk.

Full Review 
Exterior : The exterior is beautiful, no comparison.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) : Space ^ Comforts are good. Should have given leather seat covers for top end models.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox : Good pick up, new car and hence not verified fuel economy, Gearbox is satisfactory.
Ride Quality & Handling : Ride quality is smooth and better and handling is eazy.
Final Words : Good Car but pricing is little high compared to the features of Ford Ecosport which is having lot of features. Engine noise is not abnormal as stated in many reviews. Swift Dezire is no way near to the Honda Amaze and cannot be compared.
Areas of improvement : They say it is keyless entry but it is not in real sense. In Ecosport if the key is within 3 meters of the car, you can open the door and start with puch buton. hat Amaze is having only Remote Locking & Opening. Bluetooth and climate control ac (important required features) are required.

SUSPENSION: even maruthi 800 is better


Full Review 
Exterior: good looking , better than sail and dizire. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): space is enough and more, old age people love the space. Seats will need seat cover since light coloured , stain will get to it easily. less cushion 
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox : mileage good if you are driving in highways near to 22-23km/l in higways , town ride will cost u 16 - 18 km/l all with AC on . if AC is off add 1-2 km/l. definitly engine noise is a problem but similar engines are also nisy. good pickup, over take with confidence. higher the speed higher the noise.  
Ride Quality & Handling: hgih speeds car becomes unstable. good drive experience if the roads are good. best if u drive at constant speeds. less noise. if acclerating fast noise is higher.  
Final Words: Lot of work to be done in the suspension departement. even maruthi 800 can give u a better suspension. Honda is nuts in adding such a suspension. ur spine will get a feel of all the holes in the road. back seat the shaking is much greater. Dont place ur elders in the back seat. = dangerous. 
 lot of boot space , u can fit a small home in the dicky. no idea about the service charges will post after i do paid service first two services are free. nothing special in the free service, check , tight and leave over in 2 hours. 
Areas of improvement  : Definitly Suspension . if you want to take ur elders( as I was planning )  for vaccation take another vehicle otherwise they will be in hospital due to back ache once you come back from the tour.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interier space, boot space and comfort specially in the back seat is best in this segment but No GPS & blue tooth connectivity.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Best in this segment but noissy in ridding the hilly areas.
Ride Quality & Handling Best in this segment.
Final Words I would prefer everyone buy this car.
Areas of improvement Front view and width of he car likely to be improved,to include GPS & blue tooth connectivity.

 Great exterior looks - unmatched so far in this segment.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Superb space in a compact sedan. Very comfortable car. Dashboard is a bit basic but has most of the useful features built in.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Excellent engine - if we ignore the engine noise then its the best available diesel engine in market today. Its pickup/mileage/driveability is best in all segments - no turbo lag - equally suited for city driving, highways, hilly areas. I am getting close to 20kpl in peak hours city driving with 100% AC on.
Ride Quality & Handling
 I am loving driving this car. Its excellent so far.
Final Words
 Great car with excellent engine. Ignore the diesel engine noise and go for it!
Areas of improvement  
 Improve the interiors and reduce the noise inside the cabin.

Full Review 
Exterior The exterior design is too good and stylish. Gives you the feel of a big car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space is good both in front and rear. Leg space is more and very comfortable for longer drives. The built in features are also good and the seat cusions are soft. The arm rest provided in the rear is comfortable and gives you the feel of a sedan. Has enough cup holders for you to enjoy the long drives with families and friends
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is very smooth except for the noise. Even though the noise is low when compared to other diesel cars its quite irritating. The noise disappears after you reach a speed of 50kmph. You wont feel the noise if you are listening to some music. Gives an excellent mileage, I have driven around 150km as of now and it gives me a mileage of 18kmpl with AC inside Bangalore city traffic. (As shown by the fuel economy indicator). Gear shift is easy, it has short gear system.
Ride Quality & Handling Gives you a amazing driving experience. If you had switched from an hatchback to sedan, dont worry as it is very easy to judge. Have to be little careful as the pick up is more and might zoom out quickly before you realize.
Final Words Worth the money you pay for!!!

Full Review 
Exterior
Looks are just amazing. The car looks like a premium segment vehicle. In comparison, DZire has become a little old.
Amaze doesn't look like a hacked up Brio in any sense which is a very big advantage. DZire looks like Swift which is a big disadvantage. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Ample space for average Indian with 5.8/10 height.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Diesel is a super performer, 1498cc is a big plus. There is literally no turbo lag which is very evident in DZire.
ARAI rates this vehicle to have 26 kmpl. Now that's a big number. It gives 20-21 on Highways and 18-19 in city which is good 3-4 Kmpl higher than its competitors. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Very smooth vehicle. The suspensions are not stiff and the steering is very responsive. The top end VXMT iDTEC is fully loaded and has all safety features. All that in 5-6k lesser than a ZDi DZire.
Only Automatic Climate Control is lacking in the vehicle. Could have given a boost to its already high on-road mileage.
Final Words
Very good vehicle. Truly Honda has hit the nail right as it did with City many years ago. 
Areas of improvement  
iDTEC is noisy, it does have a humming sound which many will find irritating. Audio system and the dashboard need an uplift. It is too contemporary for a peppy vehicle like Amaze. Don't want it like Chevy Beat which looks more like a bike than car from inside, but at least have the sleek lining of DZire whose interior styling defnitely beats Amaze.

Full Review 
Exterior Apart from the frontal design, it is so cute and elegant.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Man maximum and machine minimum is the normal design strategy of Honda vehicles and they kept their word in Amaze as well. The back seat is ergonomically carved to accommodate three adults.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent performance and highly responsive. It gives an average mileage of 25/ L in the highways at a decent speed of 80 KM/ Hour.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride is good but the balance is bit shaky after 100 Km/hr. But I have pushed it till 140 KM/hr. I felt bit edgy when it crossed 100. It may be because of low weight of the vehicle. But I dont feel it as a problem.
Final Words Value for money for an entry level sedan. A true competition for Maruti Swift Dzire and has been a notch high in terms of performance.
Areas of improvement Design of head light cluster, engine noice (its quite common in all diesel engines), etc.

Full Review 
Exterior Very good exterior design but with limited colour options. Cost cutting visible in many areas.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Not very feature rich but has all essentials required. The Dashboard looks odd ans a straight fit from the Brio, which could have been better for a car of this segment. Cost cutting visible everywhere. Very spacious, with ample leg space and thigh support. Driver seat height adjustment very useful during long distance drives. The console  not so appealing.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent engine with good pick-up and fuel effeciency. But the body does not seem strong enough for the engine of this capacity and capability. Gearbox is smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good but for the vibration felt by the driver when rpm is more. Very stable at high speeds and handles corners very easily even at high speeds. Very stiff suspension and hence handles small bumps with a thud if not taken slowly. 
Final Words A good family car and good value for the money. Expect the reliability froim Honda. Satisfied customer.
Areas of improvement Thickness of the sheet metal. Music system. Console, Some external improvements to take care of the Indian road conditions.

Ride Quality & Handling Smooth and comfortable for its class and handles well. very happy with the quality of the ride.
Final Words A car worth owning for its class, if you are a car lover you will never regret buying it. I do city driving and long distance its a good drive.
Areas of improvement Interiors music system,dash board. smoother gears. A little engine noise insulation for the interiors. More clearence a bit knowing Indian Roads.

Exterior
 Exterior is superb with crease lines and curves. People will stand and look at curvacious body. Best view of the car is from the rear. It looks very sexy, stylish and  more over looks like younger cousin of Mercedes benz.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Space and comfort is great considering it is a sub-compact car. Car is not rich in features. Basic things like power outlet or cigarette lighter point does not come in base version. Even my Maruti 800 had cigaretter lighter point about 7 years back. Featurewise not so rich like swift Dzire
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 One of the best diesel engines in India. First day after taking the delivery I started getting fuel efficieny of 18.2 kmpl. It is two days since I bought my car. I have travelled about 200 kms, already I am getting a FE of 20 kmpl per litre (diesel). Engine performance is the best part of the car. It is as powerful as Innova meant for carrying 7 or 8 people. Overtaking is a breeze.
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride quality and handling is good. Very precise steering. Best for ladies who fear that my car might go somewhere and hit. You point the steering and press the pedal, car will go straight there.
Final Words
 Value for money car. You will be amazed every millisecond you are in the car. I would vote this as the best car of 2013 amoung launches. I would not have bought this car, if I had not accidentally walked into Dakshin Honda showroom on Lavelle road. One test drive made me to change my decision and booked this car instead of Ritz Vdi-ABS. Probably it is the only car in the country where even base versions come with ABS-EBD. Thanks to Honda for considering safety of passangers rather than trying to make money.
Areas of improvement  
 NVH needs to be in level with Dzire. Honda needs to advertise on TV and print media more. Many people are not aware of it's great power, mileage, space and comfort. Dealer network should be strengthened in all cities of India to pull the crowd away from Maruti. Finally most important point from Indian consumers point of view, spare parts must be cheap, you cannot charge exhorbitant price for accessories.

Highest fuel average achieved so far, 26.1 Kmpl (calculated on a distance of 202 km inclusive of highway and city drive). Lowest fuel average achieved 17.2 Kmpl. Impressive Boot space. Cabin sapce is excellent. Good control. Ground clearance is not satisfactory. Doesnt feel that heavy while driving. Suspension is not satisfactory.
Good Value for money. For those living in urban areas and often travels long distance during weekends, the Amaze i DTEC is a blessing. I have driven 2700 km in 27 days which includes highway, city traffic, hilly gravel road as well as bumpy ones. Only on two occasions with 7 persons ( 4 adults + 3 children) on board, the car kissed the ground in a speed braker. However, the kissing didnot happen during back journery at the respective speedbrakers. Be very slow and calm in bumpy brakers. Though lot complained of the engine noise, but I have no such views. It is lot cool and silent compared to Tata, Mahindra and Ford. 
Beautiful back side. However, the front looks dwarf. 
I am satisfied with my car.

Exterior
New sporty vibrant exterior looks, boot from outside too looks elegant, windows are very well designed, bonnet though gives more of a hatchback look if looked at from sides (that's where honda saved taxes to bring it down to a compact sedan length and thus lowered the price when it initially started hurting the etios)

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
cabin space above average, seats comfy, head, leg room sufficient, missing some very basic stuff in base models like a simply vanity mirror, dashboard does lose specially in the bottom two models where the 1 DIN audio system has not been placed in the centre and gives a odd look upfront to the dashboard,  instrument panel very basic by today's standards,
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gears
Diesel engine sound is quite average and don't expect a silent engine. Fuel economy is very acceptable and infact if you are a driver who drives with sound judgement, experience and lesser use of brakes and acceleration, you can save a lot of bucks with diesel engines like this one, gears are slightly on the tougher side and could have been better
 
Final Words
Buy it if your thinking between dezire, sail, etios and amaze. It's as simple as that, it is higher value for money than an etios, much newer and advanced than  a dezire and more vibrant and sporty than a sail if at par with everything else!
 
Areas of improvement  
The car offers you what you should get in this budget. I would say, improve you financial status and buy a City or an Accord rather than asking an amaze to improve..

Full Review 
Exterior Very smart finish with prominent lines from the tail gate, looks quite smart from the rear with large tail lamps. Front is pretty good with dual spoke front grill and also large headlights, over all very smart looking design. The best designing factor is that the boot has been integrated very neatly to the body design and don’t feel odd the way the D'zire looks 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are not that impressive though they could have done a better job however seats are very well designed and comfortable, the best point is that the rear seats are so spacious with an arm rest is a plus point while compared to other models in this segment. Lot of space to stow your water bottles and the front seat is curved from back side to make more room sitting in the rear seat.... they should have provided back seat pouches for storage. The best part is the trunk and it is of 400 liters which is very essential for an average Indian family while travelling out of stations and this is a clear cut advantage over other cars in this segment.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Indeed Performance is very snappy and quick response for a diesel car, however the clutch should have been tad bit smoother (expected from Honda's reputation). Gear shifting is a pleasure and very close and performs pretty well even in the busy city traffic roads. As regards to the fuel economy it is pretty good but not to the promises of Honda but for sure it returns the best in class fuel economy. Fantastic pick up and absolutely no lag in the performance.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is very smooth as accepted and handles very well as the steering response is immense and the turning radius is fantastic. It gives a great feel while driving and never makes you feel that you are driving a diesel car but for the cabin noise
Final Words Very good car but to my feeling it is a bit over priced and they should have considered a better interiors and some latest features like Blue tooth etc.,
Areas of improvement I thoroughly feel that they should have given a push button start in all the variants and also should seriously consider upgrading the interiors. Must add an armrest to the drivers seat for the comfort. They should think of a better music system than that of the existing one. They should have incorporated an airbag at least for the driver.

Exterior Exterior is aesthetically designed unlike dzire. I feel Dzire front part somehow dont match the boot... Sail was the best in exterior design infact.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Great and comfortable  cabin space but interior design not so appealing.. Its decent though. Music system is average . the power windows and other buttons near the door are almost invisible during nights even with light on. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is noisy for sure. Idling is fine but as soon as u give some acceleration the noise increases . It happens with diesel engines . fuel economy cant comment now as i have drive very little so far . Gear box is hard but compact and solid . same goes with steering too. Its compact , small but solid.. Gives you an awesome feel while driving . Clutch is also smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is just awesome. Handling is stable even at 120km /hr  . Breaks are splendid.
Final Words Its a real good compact sedan. Its spacious, ridequality is good and most importantly fuel efficient. What else u need.
Areas of improvement
1. nvh levels.
2. Features like defogger and fog lamp have to come in mid segment variant itself.

Exterior : Nice look and edges.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Comfort seating.Ample of legroom. But no comparison with the interiors of other cars of same budget like Swift Dzire etc.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Engine is abit noisy. Even after the third service and driving 8000 km (Mostly delhi-chandigarh highway) i am getting a fuel efficiency of 15kmpl that is not even close to what claimed(25kmpl) by the company.I understand the conditions in which they claim the fuel efficiency are different from daily life, but mostly driving the car with ECO indicator on i am not getting a satisfactory fuel efficiency.Even the pick up power is low as compared to swift. Even on full throttle it takes its complete time to achieve a good speed.
 
Ride Quality & Handling:Even at a speed of 130 kmph the handling is very nice.
 
Final Words: Not a value for money.In the same cost on can get a hold on to other cars with better interiors and fuel efficiency.All you get after buying this car is the Branding of Honda.
 
Areas of improvement  : Fuel efficiency need a drastic improvement.Interiors also can be improved for a better look and feel from inside.

Exterior FANTASTIC LOOK.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) SUPERB LEG ROOM, SEATS AND ARRANGEMENT GIVES YOU UNBELEIVABLE COMFORT, BEIGE LOOK FOR THE SEATS LOOKS VERY OFFICIAL.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 1.5L AT 1750RPM GIVES YOU AWESOME POWER: U WILL FEEL THE TAKEOFF WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE PEDAL AT SECOND GEAR. ery good fuel economy of 23.5 kmpl if no AC and speed is maintained at around 70-80kmpl. WITH AC AN HIGH SPEEDS IT IS OBVIOUS FUEL EFFICIENCY REDUCES I GOT AROUND 17.5KMPL.
Ride Quality & Handling YOU WILL NOT GET TIRED ON LONG DRIVES AND HANDLING THE VEHICLE AT HIGH SPEEDS IS VERY SMOOTH. AC IS GOOD: NO PROBLEMS FOR PERSON SEATED IN BACK ROW.
Final Words GO FOR IT. U WILL REALISE MY WORDS.
Areas of improvement GROUND CLEARANCE IS VERY LOW. U WILL HAVE TO DRIVE ON HUMPS IN A SNAILS PACE OR OTHERWISE IT IS GUARANTEED YOU WILL FEEL THE BUMP ON THE HUMP. ENGINE SOUND IS MANAGABLE - U WILL HERE ONLY IF YOU INTENTIONALLY TRY TO HEAR OR IT WILL GO UN-NOTICED.

Full Review 
One year back in the April 2014 I purchased Amaze Diesel top end model with the image of Honda Quality. Till now in one year I had running of 12,000 KM.I shifted from Tata Indica DSL to Amaze. I used Indica for around 9 years and was satisfied with the car and its overall performance. It was really Value for Money.
Exterior Good Looks and design. Rear view and side mirrors are properly placed and covers maximum possible  area. Also electronically mirror adjustment and folding from inside is very comfortable.
Quality of the body metal is very thin and paint quality is poor. I had taffeta white colour car and its paint quality is very poor.
Design/placing of the wheel need to improve. If road is rough, it throws small stones on the external part of the car sides and because of this there are dents on side body the next to rare doors of the car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very good space and comfort for driving Quality of material use for interior is average. Size of the glove box is very small.
I am not sure if the placing of steering axel rod is proper, because when we press the clutch, steering axel rod touches to our feet and we can sense its movement. It is definitely not a comfort feeling and has concern about safety, because  it gives uncomfortable feeling of thinking about immediate impact of this rod in case of an accident.
Boot Space is very good among the various options available in this segment. Dicey door is not covered from inside. The space between dicey doors external sheet and inter plates/rods is open and visible. It could create a problem if and part of the luggage or say handle of bat/stick etc. stuck in it then it may get locked from inside or even a small parts of luggage may stuck into it. If it would have covered with a small piece of board sheet, I do not think that, it would have much cost impact.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is little bit noisy,  I was expecting smoothing of its noise after running for 10k kms, but it is not so. If there are limitations in reducing in built noise of the engine, still in the present case it could have suppress to a large extent if it provides a thick and bigger fabric/canvas sheet as inner to bonnet of the engine. The present size of the sheet is very small and also it is very thin.
Gearbox is hard. It is informed that, the gear box is of polymer material and not of the metal. For me it developed a little muscle / ligament pain in the left palm.
Fuel economy claim by the Company is misleading. In the city(70%) and Highway(30%) average fuel economy is around 16.3 km/ltr.  My 9 years old Tata Indica car was giving better fuel economy than this new car.
Ride Quality & Handling It gives amaze pleasure in riding and comfortable in driving. It has very good power, torque and pick-up.
Final Words To carry the banding and image of the Honda, it needs certain improvements. Fuel efficiency claimed by the Company is misleading.
Areas of improvement Fuel efficiency, Paint Quality, Body metal quality/thickness.
Front wheel placing to avoid small stone throw on the side body of the car.
Quality of material used for interior.
Cover /close the dickey door from inside.
About placing of steering axel rod, refer observation above.
Size and thickness of fabric/canvas sheet as inner to bonnet of the engine to suppress the engine noise and quality of insulation used between engine area and cabin of the car.

Exterior Looks great, curvy ends.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Perfect front row seats, back seats are extremely comfortable for 2 adults. arm rest is good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I am getting great milege in long drives, I got 28KM/L on a 1000KM drive.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling is the best part. It is easy to handle like a Maruti 800. Ride quality is good.
Final Words It is a value for money vehicle. Go for it. I am using it from October 2013. The AC is powerful compared to the same segment cars. No power dip when AC is on. Good Interiors, plastic quality is fine. Nice steering wheel a bit heavy as well for great handling. Ground clearance must be improved. Also, diesel engine is a bit noisy.
Areas of improvement Diesel engine is a bit noisy but we wont feel it once the music is on. bad ground clearance. We wont expect some under body hits in even small humps.

Full Review 
Exterior Good colours, nice compact shape, nice alloy wheels, rear is good. Orvms are good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Features are not much good, no in car entertainment, only f.m or ur own selected music in ur pendrive or aux connectivity, no bluetooth, no dvd player, space in front dashboard is very less, you cant keep anything more than a cars own papers and f/a kit, comfort level is good only if you are travelling alone or three average people in car, over weight or healthy people more than two effects overall performance of the car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is 100ps 1.5 id tech which company claims to be the most fuel efficient engine, which is a big fraud, this vehicle never gives the accurate mileage which is shown in its mileage trip meter, its actual mileage is not more than 17.7, top speed if u are talking about which can never exceed to 150 km/hr, this is the biggest failure in this vehicle, this is mileage was noted on delhi to bombay throughout the highway nonstop in 19 hrs of single man drive, embarrasement was hitting highly when Swift diesel over takes you on expressway @ 150 km/hr above and hitting mileage of not less than 20km/l throughout this highway. The mileage meter shown in this car is just a show piece, before every drive you reset it and keep noting the reading on a piece of paper like we use to do in old Maruti 800's or Fiat (pal), on every trip it shows mileage more than 25.8 if you drive it at the speed of 60-75km/hr, but express ways are not made to drive at 60 or 80 km/hr, one tend to touch above 100 because speed = distance/time and time = $$ money so if u have more excess time than you may ride at 65 km/hr and wait for the meter to claim mileage of 32km/l also I've waited and even got the reading till 29 km/l which company straight away refused &said that this is not possible, I have clicked some images also, and another thing, once u top up the fuel tank reset the mileage meter and stand on idle with a/c on for half n hour or more the mileage meter will come down to as low as 1 km/ltr. So the mileage meter is just to satisfy you that u drive slowly and it may show above 22 or so, and belive me every time you go for a mileage test in company, they will immediately reset the mileage meter and drive car like on a test mode very slowly and in 5 minutes the meter will show you above 19 kn/l in city and they will say that this is the mileage this vehicle is giving in city and on highways it will give more. Power wise this vehicle is good initial power is good, but u are stopped at 150km/hr where a swift desire 1.3 ltr 70-80 bhp takes hthe gold medal and etios liva ( toyota) goes till 170 km/hr and gives you a mileage of an unbelieving 23 km/ltr. With a mix driving of speeding and eco. Over all 2 ** for honda on mileage.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling is very much amazing as its name, you can have cutting and edges at 150 km/hr, front suspensions are awesome, pickup is good, all over ride is ok.
Final Words I have a daily run of 150-200 kms, this is a comfortable car but not as promised and challanged by company, my discs and breaks have been replaced twice in 20000 kms and one year, Toyota Etios Liva I got replaces in 45000 kms in 18 months, breaks have some problems, I am looking for a change in Honda Jazz id tech. This car is not so good, I have 5 vehicles  starting from 800, Etios(Liva), Ritz diesel (major lack in breaking), Toyota Innova (d4d), Honda Amaze i-dtech.
Areas of improvement Breaking system, mileage meter and of course mileage and rear suspension, an upgrade to music system is also a mandate. Breaks.

I will talk about the base model in Diesel variant. bought @ 7.10 lacs on road. 
Exterior: Great design. Looks ravishing as compared to xcent, aspire & dzire. Looks muscular. 
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)- All power windows-great, ABS, best cabin space against dzire & xcent. Rear passengers sits comfortably similar to the front ones. lot of space between the front & back seats. AC is excellent. Engine noise is acceptable inside the cabin. 
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox- Power & pick-up is the best part in this machine. mileage is ok 22-24 on highways with AC. Gear shifts is normal. No turbo lag. Picks up very well at low gear with AC ON. 
 
Ride Quality & Handling- rRding is awesome.Handling is excellent even in tight situations and jams. At high speeds it is quite stable. 
 
Final Words- Go for it. Nothing less than this will do. 
 
Areas of improvement - Ground clearance

Exterior Nice trendy looks but be careful on narrow roads and body of the car is quite flimsy and prone to dent very easily
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Not a sedan class comfort I found Swift's seats to be more comfortable Not of Honda class at all Dashboard and interiors are pathetic they look like a cheap version made for taxi.
The front seats are quite uncomfortable in a long drive as the seats are not true bucket seats.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The only thing to speak for in Honda amaze is the engine with its phenomenal pick up and torque you can negotiate any traffic or road.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent handling and ride quality upto 130km/hr is cool the engine pick up torque manueverability of the power steering is nice although the gear is stiff at times 
Driving the car for 200kms is fun but beyond that it is not comfortable due to poor seat design.
Final Words Not a car worth so much money. Buy a swift/i20 instead, AT 9LACS YOU CAN get A MUCH BETTER CAR.

Exterior
Excellent exterior design. Honda has done well in the designing of this car
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Interiors are basic and the rear view is very poor while reversing. Reverse sensors are a must and it best to have it as standard OEM from Honda
Bluetooth connectivity is sorely missed
Height adjustable driver seat and tilt steering adjustments are there in this version
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine is very powerful and gives excellent fuel economy
Gear box is smooth
Engine is bit noisy and is clearly audible inside the cabin. (keep the music on to suppress it )
Ride Quality & Handling
Handling and Ride quality is good, except I find the clutch to be on the harder side (I was driving petrol cars before)
Final Words
Bought the car last week and done about 500 Kms so far...
Will append another review after the first service

Exterior
 Decent looks. Its not wow but no one can say its ugly.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Very Impressive compair to maruti Dizire. 3 fatty people easly enjoy rear seat comfort with impressive AC performance.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
One thing keep in mind that honda amaze fitted with 1.5 ltr diesel front engine and this car is compac sedan car. Coming engine sound in cabin is normal thing and you can hear the engine sound if your audio system is off and trust me if you hear engine sound then no need to see RPM meter in dash board..u can judge your driving still how much excellaration you are giving.
Fuel Economy : Fuel economy depend on your driving style in different types of road conditions, city or highway condition , AC or without AC and how much weight you carry in honda amaze etc. If you sudden excellarate in every gear to reach maximum speed then no car in this world will give you good millage. If you drive honda amaze with decent speed between 1500 RPM to 2000 RPM then i am sure you will get 25+ KMPL in city without AC &  with AC 20+ KMPL. Driving in 1500 RPM to 2000 RPM means you drive your car with 60 to 80 KM/Hrs in top gear. 
Gear Box : Very smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling
You can feel the power of engine while driving this amazing car. Handling is very smooth, you never feel hardness or bouring. It may be city or highway you always feel it cool,  no worry if its honda amaze. your seating postion, height adustment will always give you comfort zone for long or short drive.
Final Words
This car is amazing car which give you safe and sound drive with best ever millage so, Drive safely and follow traffic rules and regulations, know your confort speed and your car speed.

Full Review 
Exterior Looks sleek from exterior
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very plasticy feel, Not able to keep anything on dashboard or on the space  behind backseat headrest due to the angles. On very high speed, above 100kmph, did not feel safe. Got flat tyre for Michelin tyres first time in high speed. Cant drive without music on as interior noise of engine is high for our diesel version. Leg room is good. Comfort is average.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel economy is good, above average and one of the main pluses. Engine noise is high.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality average. Not upto level for a sedan experience. It is better than many of old cars, but we expected a mini version of City, which it clearly isn't.
Final Words Go for it if you want a cheap car which is fuel efficient. Do not expect Honda City like ride or experience.
Areas of improvement Noise level, Interiors, especially space behind backseats could be utilized to keep atleast tissue paper or umbrella. Right now it is useless.

Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Not upto mark.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good but noisy diesel engine and maintainance is expensive. Spares not available in market and delears demands more money as labour charge and we have to pay more for same type of spares / work as Maruti Brand. Lasting of spare is also same as Maruti. Consumables are also expensive than Maruti.
Ride Quality & Handling Very Good driving experience than Maruti.
Final Words Le sakte hain. maza aayega chalane me but Maintanance me paresaani jhelne ko tyaar rahna hoga. Brake shoe , Air filter, etc consumables k liye v dealer k paas jaana padega or labour charge  double se v jyada dena padega. dealer koi v spare sell nahi kartaa jo spare lekar bahar aap kaam karwa sako. spare open market me nahi milega. fir v lena chaho to Mubaarak. Mai to avi jhelunga hi, chuki gaadi kharid li hai to taarif to karani hi padegi.
Areas of improvement Please supply consumables in open market also. I am living in Bokaro (Jharkhand). min. distance dealer is 55 kms away. If any brakedown arise I am helpless or pay more money to dealer as outstation service charge. etc.

Full Review 
Exterior Aggressive Aston Martin inspired front grille stance, Aesthetic looking swept back headlamps, Overall exterior looks feels fresh and dynamic, does not try to extend the sporty feature from the front across the car giving it a balanced look and a well executed design.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is mostly beige in shade providing an airy feel to the cabin and there are almost close to 20 usable slots in the front section, Passenger seat comfort is excellent and it provides good under thigh support, Rear seat is equally comfortable for long journey and has good amount of leg space for rear passenger, overall execution of interiors is done practically.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 1.5 TDCi engine grabs all the spotlight for this car,the surge of torque starts kicking in from as low as 1300 RPM which prompts you up shift gears quickly and there is virtually no turbo lag felt which makes it easier to drive.
I have completed 800 kms of driving on this car after I took delivery on 4th Sep which includes a maiden trip of Mumbai-Pune expressway, mileage I am getting currently is at 17.7 kpl, Gearbox is easy to operate and it is not very stiff while moving across different gears.
Ride Quality & Handling Figo Aspire's suspension handles minor bumps and bad roads with ease and there is not much body roll felt. Overall handling of the car is good however on the highway under steering is experienced around sharp corners due to small OEM tyre size. NVH levels inside the cabin is excellent, Steering is very light to operate in the city. Turning radius at 4.9m provides good maneuverability.
Final Words Diesel engine is the star performer for Ford here and I am very satisfied with the overall pre-sales, delivery and initial ownership. This is my first diesel car and after selling my Petrol (LT) Chevrolet Beat I am pinning my hopes on a reasonably hassle free after sales service from dealer and the company.
Areas of improvement There are some noticeable panel gaps around headlight cluster, boot section and front bumper though not very wide however it is not expected from a car of this category and navigating on USB to access music across folders is very distracting, which makes it better to stick to listening to music via Bluetooth. If you like pushing car around corners and prefer better stability to mileage then swapping of OEM tyres is mandatory.

Full Review 
Exterior The front grills are awesome and nose is very well placed.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) It includes all features that are available with competitors in similar versions except  ABS, I feel that it can be added in lower versions. Space is good for a family of 5 people. Driving comfort is good in city/highway.  On Hilly roads also the car performance is very nice. The car absorbs well, all the shocks from bad uneven roads. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine preformance is awesome with 100Ps on ghat roads and even in city it do nice, fuel consumption is moderate and it can be best after 1st service.
The gear ratios are well prpotioned.
Ride Quality & Handling Simply awesome. Just effortless, you wont get tired driving this car. Drive even at 140 Km/hr and you wont even know at what speed you are at.
Final Words After all we are all buying a car for the Engine and the safety, others are all useless. In this aspect I chose to buy Ford figo aspire, becoz the company provides 100Ps engine and 2 Airbags in all variants.
Areas of improvement Nothing.

Exterior
The look of this car always confuses other people if its a budget car or a high end sedan.The front grill of this car with that chrome finish gives it a stylish view.Rear of this car is a bit on the upper side,but it doesnt look like the boot has been attached to it atall.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Interior is beige and black with a nice finishing touch to every nook and corner.The seats are comfy too and enough space for 3 medium sized people easily.The AC is powerful enough,cools down the entire cabin in a few minutes,so no need to put it on the whole time.Sound system is excellent and sufficient with 4 speakers.A really good feature is the aux point and usb point in the MyFordDock panel,which can be used easily with no worry of the phone tripping over even in bridge traffics and panic braking.Steering wheel itself has a control panel of this infotainment system so no need to extend to that main panel.It even has bluetooth connectivity to phones and other devices and feature to import all contacts.The cabin insulation also is really good and feels neglegible discomfort when goes through a pot hole.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine is really powerful and rev it beyond 1700 rpm and it is just a joy to ride.The torque is excellent,215Nm is really good enough for this segment.Apparently no presence of turbo lag....can even ride as low as 15kmph from 3rd gear.Currently she gives me 15kmpl in the cities but then again i ride around 1st and 2nd around 3000 rpm,so its a different story,but when driven perfectly it gave around 20-22 kmpl which was with AC off.The gearbox is smooth,no issues there.
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride Qualty is good as I mentioned above,absorbs all the bumps and holes smoothly.Even when it is at higher speeds of upto 130-140,it feels under control.The steering response is good and helps alot in city traffic and highways as well.
Final Words
I was suggested by other people to go for other car in the same segment,but we went for this one and except one minor problem of the speakers not playing which was internally disturbed because i wasnt used to the new cars pickup and torque....hehe took me 2 dasy to get used to it but the ford service guys responded quickly and took the car to service centre the same day itself.Kuddos for Wasan Ford in Bombay.All things apart,Aspire is an excellent family car and has good power,good fuel economy,good space and importantly lots of safety and practicality.Value for money.
Areas of improvement  
Honestly,please include the driver seat height adjustment,no problem for men while driving but women need one.Include the parking sensor....really necessary in big cities.Havent come across anything else other than this.

Full Review 
I got my diesel Aspire car in Sep 2015 already clocked 10K due for 2nd service, done some good running in both city(bangalore) and Highway below are my view.
Exterior Aggressive front look and cool side look although tyres are small but decent could use a day light runing lamp.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Top end comes with cool features very helpful if you utilize them regularly, inside is very specious both at front and back I am 6ft and I seat comfortably, suspensions are good but be careful while in full load and passing over a road hump sudden brake tends hit the hump.
Engine Performance 100PS power is awsome you can feel it when you accelerate it easily takes pick up even after you have reached triple speed figure effortless easy to drive in traffic and fun to cruise on highway.
Fuel Economy I got an average of 13 - 14Kmpl in Bangalores bumper to bumper traffic with AC, Highway got an average of 17Kmpl with AC on and crusing speed 120Kmph+  and around 19Kmpl with out AC and crusing speeds of around 110Kmph. The mileage is suppose to improve after 2nd service as per service center guys.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality is good it sokes the bumps rely good you don't get tired even after long hours of driving. Handling is very good the stering is very reactive and cornering can be done with confidence. Surprisingly the small tyres handle the road very good. 
Final Words Overall a good package for a fair price deal in the segment.
Areas of improvement Gear box.

Full Review 
Exterior
Looks really interesting (agressiveness combined with elegance) as it has a unique grill (reminds me of good old Ambi) and swept back headlight cluster make it stand of the crowd. Although it is a sub-four meter car, the proportions are best in-class. The side profile looks very sober (chrome door cladding can be added liven it up) - this is where the 14 inch wheels look smaller - 15 inch would look a lot better. The rear looks bit odd (common issue in CS segment) and has been kept simple with horizontal chrome cladding - it has enough luggage space for a small family.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
The build quality of the cabin is one of the best if not the best in the segment. The moment you step into the car, you can realize the amount of space it has to offer, just fantastic. During Indian summer, you can keep yourself and family very comfortable as this car has a very powerful AC - also the Ford technician told me that AC load is distributed between battery (80%) and engine (20%) so driving performance is not compromised. The instrument cluster is small but looks nice and clear with light blue/cyan color - other systems (engine warning, overheating, seatbelt, high/low beam, fogs etc) have different colors. Another major feature is the docking station, which can hold your phone/GPS device for ease of use. The USB and Aux are built into the rare of docking station. The steering mounted audio/media controls are nice easy to use.
There are lot of cubby holes and bottle holders - but none at the rare. The front seats are wide and very comfortable for long trips - recommed to get seat covers for longivity. Both front and rare seat headrests are adjustable.The center console is similar to that of Eco-sport and Fiesta - looks smart and elegant. It has multiple connectivity options - Aux, Bluetooth, USB, Phone book sync/dial feature etc (Ford MyKey and Sync features are available in top end variant). The USB requires FAT32 format or it may throw an error :(. The lights are managed interestingly and has been put seperately on the right side below the steering. The rare windows do not go down completely - 10% remains visible. Rare seats get central arm-rest adding to the comfort factor.  
Overall I like the way everything falls to hand so nicely. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Most importantly, how does it performe on the road? To answer it straight, You will simply fall in Love with the 1.5 TDCi :)
It is not a brand new engine - it has been delivering power to Feista, Eco-sport but has been fine tuned for more power (100 PS) and better mileage. The dirivability and refinement levels are fantastic. It does not hesitate and can easily pick-up in 3rd gear from low as 15 kmph. The amount of torque (215 Nm) available across the rev-range is briliant. The fixed geometry turbo kicks in early (1400 RPM approx) making driving in trafic effortless (giving quick reaction). I have noticed that even you are in 2 or 3 gear and do not press the accelarator, the car accelarates on its own (torque talks here) :). You can only hear the engine when its idling (standstill) or when pushed over 3K RPM - that means good NVH level inside cabin. This engine is matted to a 5 speed tranmission and has short and precise throws - making things more exciting for the driver. In city runs (office - home) with AC on full time, it should return 19-21 kmpl (with light foot) - which is Great :) The steering is light and chunky to hold. It weighs nicely up as you pick up speed. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Ford cars have been known for their ride and handling qualities and this one is no different :) It has been further optimized for Indian roads and makes the car glide over pot-holes or bumpy roads. On highways it behaves like a well oiled machine - stable, composed and poised at high speeds - giving a lot of confidence to driver and passengers. 
The unique thing about Aspire is that it comes with 2 front airbags as standard across all variants (top end gets 6 airbags) - this is the class leading feature in this segment. 
Final Words
If you are looking for safe, comfortable, efficient and exciting to drive car? Well look no further, the Ford Figo Aspire is just for you.
It is so much fun to drive that you may want to drive it on and on and on... :). Although Ford is late to the party (segment already has Maruti Swift Desire, Hyundai Xcent, Honda Amaze and Tata Zest), but after driving the Ford Figo Aspire, I am confident that it has potential to top the list.
Areas of improvement  
I found the outer body/pannel light weight - it virbrates if car audio volume is high (80+%) - this can be attributed to the lightness of this vehicle - just over a 1 ton. The pannel gaps are wide - they could have been reduced. The rare bumper is almost flat and does not provide any cover/protection to boot lid - any rare impact may cause body damage. There is no engine cover (as in Fiesta or Eco-sport) although it has provision for a cover.

Exterior
I found exterior is very stylish and build quality is much better than other sedan of this segment
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
I have family of 4 people and did not feel any lack of space
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
I have completed 3000+ kms of driving on this car after I took delivery on 28th Aug which includes a expressway trip.Mileage I am getting currently in city is at 15-17(With ac) kpl without ac yet to be tested. 
On highway it delivered 20 kpl with full time ac was on. 
Gearbox is easy to operate and it is not very stiff while moving across different gears.
Air conditioning is extreamly well and it cools cabin in shorter time.
Ride Quality & Handling
Wirh turning radius at 4.9m provides good maneuverability in the city and highway.
Final Words
Diesel engine has better performance over pertrol version. No turbo lag.
I have upgreaded myself from Maruti wagonR.
Areas of improvement  
Rear seat passengers should have bottle holders.
Front glow box should be little big. should have small cool comparment for cold drinks and chocolates.

My Fav car is Hyundai Verna, Though I couldn't afford a diesel version of it, so I thought of looking in to any other car that comes below 8 lacs price tag. Then I met in love with this fantastic car called Ford Aspire. I really surprised to see that this is almost equal to Verna in all departments.
Exterior New and Great fresh look with the Aston martin inspired grill. On exterior look you really feel its an premium car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good and Spacious beige interiors with great looking dashboard.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Mine is Diesel TDCI 1.5 liter engine. its awsome and so silent when compared to its rivals ex, Vento/Rapid, they are very noisy.
Ride Quality & Handling Great.
Final Words A total worth for the money I have put. so a happy satisfied customer.
Areas of improvement Panel Gaps, Central locking system, Child lock features and so on, I have completed my review.

Exterior Looks stylish...definitely a head Turner. Nicely designed.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Ample space for water bottles in doors, spacious (I am 6') and comfortable seats.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is excellent. Moves according to your requirement. Fuel economy is enormous. If you drive in between 55-65 kmph strictly following the gear transmission indicator, you will definitely get above 30 kmpl on normal double lane roads (7 meters wide Bituminous top road) (I have tested with full tank 40 less of diesel drove for 1320 km). Took vehicle on 16 th august. Completed 18000 km.
Ride Quality & Handling Simply superb. Steering bit lighter than classic but gets weight according to speed. Superb handling. Have tested top speed too 190 kmph on Hyderabad ORR.
Final Words Value for money.
Areas of improvement Central door locking is absent. For child safety you need to manually lock rear doors and front doors you are helpless. Your child may open door while car is in motion.

Exterior Its by far better then all other cars of same segment and honestly does not looks like just a 4m compact sedan. Looks bigger with the front Aston Martin Grille
Everything is in perfect proportion. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Lots of small Pockets + Mobile Holder ( unique feature only in ford ) + Rear seating is very comfortable. One touch trunk opener. + Also with Remote 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is a little Noisy and also it lacks one more gear. With a power of 100ps it should have got one more gear to go for a smoother ride above 110km/hr. But performance wise, Pick up everything is very nice. 
FOrd has really worked on giving a perfect package with everything clubbed in just once car. I have driven 6000 kms in 60 days of purchasing the car n average is 20kmpl till date.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality + Suspension is really good. 
Final Words If u want Power + Mileage + Looks + Budget then u can't find a better option then ASPIRE. Anyone thinking to purchase compact sedan must test ride ASPIRE for once. For sure he will go for it.
Areas of improvement Engine sound on the outiside. + 6th Gear.

Exterior Good Appearance from front and side, Front Grill and Ruby Red clolour are adding more beauty to the car. Rear view is normal, looks like something is missing.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Driving is comfortable, Co-driver and rear seat also having enough space and no complaint. Audio, AC, Centralised lock, Head light reminder, Bluetooth, Dock and other features are really useful and i am excited.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is resposive and helps to drive smooth for the new drivers. Fuel economy is as expected for me 20KMPL mixed driving on City and Highway. Gear box is average.
Ride Quality & Handling Enjoyed my 1000km ride, Good quality and handling.
Final Words Value for money, Accesorries are bit costlier so i have purchased from outsider.
Areas of improvement Some times reverse gear is not fixing properly. Rear power windows not working in my car. Rust in front disk wheels. Unnecessary long waiting period, i got my car after 75 days even after pre-booking.

The car is just sweet Looks and power of the Aspire. The ride feel so smooth just goes like a butter. Tho it's disel car is so silent engine sound is hardly able to hear. Feelslike ua riding a petrol car. The speed and pick up is just awesome totally and awesome car ever till the date. I guess its the ford's best car on road as of today. if you start driving the car you feel like driving it all the day you won't feel stressed or fell bored of the car. on the long the car's power and stability is just wow cruises like anything.Aggressive Aston Martin inspired front grille stance, Aesthetic looking swept back headlamps, Overall exterior looks feels fresh and dynamic, does not try to extend the sporty feature from the front across the car giving it a balanced look and a well executed design.Diesel engine is the star performer for Ford here and I am very satisfied with the overall pre-sales, delivery and initial ownership. This is my first diesel car and after selling my Petrol Hyundai I10 I am pinning my hopes on a reasonably hassle free after sales service from dealer and the company.

Full Review 
TATA has done great work in field of styling & driving pleasure. Car exterior is very fresh & class leading. Interior is inspired by premium class which is quite visible in Dash board.
Infotainment system are very good & give a feel of luxary & no competetior can beat in this .
Ride& Handelling is top class. Highway driving provides enough control over vehicle & city  driving is quite good, everyone love to drive.
Lot of work has been done for fit & finish. It is no more TATA's old car, now it give strong competetion to all leaders in premium segment, Thanks to JLR who guided TATA in this way to make class leading interiors & exteriors with clean fit & finish.
Mileage is very good & every one will ove to drive in three driving mode ECO,CITY & SPORT as per their driving habit . From a fuel concious person to sport enthuasiit everyone love to drive this car. It will provide ~ 19-21 avg on highway which is very good.
Now next thing will roam arround TATA sales & service . But I had visited some f them flagship delaership like concorde they are best & others are no more behind . Service is also improved a lot. All the work has been being done to minimise the effort of customer & incresing his satis faction.
Wish a all the Best for truly Indian Car. It will also restrict to flow indian currency in foreign hand. Now we can say This is It. Less drive, enjoy & share.

Exterior Beautiful car with lots of kick in it. Didn't found it like a Tata product initially,must say Tata motors did a lovely job. It looks masculine, have better ground clearance.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Awesome is the word which justify the interiors. Music System, Steering Controls, Bluetooth system for audio streaming and phone, sporty steering, each detail was looked into and brought to its best by Tata Motors.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performace is good though in first gear you will feel the heavy weight of the car which is restricting its pick-up at slower speeds but once you rev it up it cruises like a completer luxury sedan.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is the area where it scores very high as compared to Amaze and Xcent, I took drive of every competition car but I must say Tata Zest scores very high here.
Final Words Lovely product from Tata Motors which will bring back the fortunes to this group in Indian passenger car segment.
Areas of improvement Though not have any area to mention as of now but After sale service is the area where I would like to see as to how they perform in future.

Exterior : Excellent designing, aero dynamic, sturdy. Stands out from the commonly seen cars. Alloy wheels adds beauty to the car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) : Excellent again, Spacious, comfortable seats, Harman infotainment is awesome, played some old Illayaraja songs during our drive to Yercaud, entire family enjoyed the music output.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox : Smooth gears and good engine response make the drive enjoyable. I get around 20 KMPL in long drives and 16 in city. 
Ride Quality & Handling: Smooth driving, car is sturdy enough to make the drive smoother at 110 speed, you don’t even feel you are above 100 speed
Final Words The best car in compact sedan category, value for money, you can buy it without a second thought.
Areas of improvement The show room staff should be trained to be confident, they have the best product and need to flaunt it. Other car makers flaunt every bit of it, for example ABS, you will find them mentioned in the rear of the car, we don’t notice in TATA CARS even though they are feature rich. Advertising a bit on the car itself will boost sales.

 Car's exterior is very good and much better than other cars in this segment. Impressive from fron, rear & side.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Spacious cabin and host of features. I couldnt have expected better than this in this segment.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 I recieved fuel economy of 17-19 kmpl in my 2000 km odometer. Engine is smooth and NVH levels are acceptable. Gearbox is smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Very smooth ride and handling, i love this car
Final Words
 This is the first time i loved the TATA car. I am completely astonished by overall package others cant offer. If you are looking for amaze, dzire & Xcent, give this car a serious thought because this is better than others. Just go for it.
Areas of improvement  
Dealer services are not as good as other offers. I want TATA to work in this area.
This is only problem which is against this car.
I have not recieved my dealer accesories yet even after 15 days of purchasing the car.

Full Review 
Exterior Well, it needs no elaboration as even a person who hasn't driven the zest himself will vouch for its cute styling & looks, must say it is a stunner in its segment.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Absolutely No doubt about it and i have no qualms in mentioning that it is indeed a feature rich car. Tata Designers, Developers & Engineers have spared no efforts to incorporate every little conceivable safety, & infotainment feature in the car. Be it  Air Bags, ABS, Rear parking sensor, Rear Defogger, Day Time Running Lights, Distance to empty, Avg Fuel consumption etc. And to top the charts, the icing on the cake is a very high end  Harmaan Audio System. I purchased my zest xt in January 2015 and I have come to know that the present zest models in the market are even offering navigation and video play back feature also. The car is very comfortable on long rides, suspension is pretty decent provided you don't deliberately jump the car over large Pot-holes. Engine Noise inside the cabin is almost negligible, considering its a diesel engine. Gear shift is very smooth and no vibration in the gear stick. I don't know what R&D Tata has done with the Steering but after driving Zest when  you drive any other car with power steering, you will definately feel that you are driving a vehicle sans the power steering. In short, Power Steering in Zest is super smooth & light and feels equally sturdy on Highways at high speeds. You don't feel fatigued after travelling long distance due to the high driving position & comfortable seats. A sore point is Tata failed to provide sufficient storage spaces & bottle holders inside.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is good & very refined, considering its the tried & tested Fiat 1.3 Quadrajet engine. Power delivery is good as the engine is tuned to 90 PS. It depends upon an individual's driving style, so if someone is in the habit of pressing on the gas in the second gear then he might feel a lil disappointed as the real power kicks in the 3rd and 4th gear when the Turbo surges in. Over taking is no problem and you get the desired  power to race ahead when needed on the highway. In city driving (Delhi & Gurgaon)I'm getting a mileage of 14 kmpl with AC and on the Highway I've managed 18 Kmpl with AC and you would be pleasantly surprised when you will see your zest returning impressive figures of 17-18 kmpl while driving in hills. One really nice feature in the car is the Avg. fuel consumption meter and believe me its not off the mark. I have noticed that by calculating the mileage by completely filling the fuel tank and then filling it again, the figures i got were almost comparable with the figures displayed by the avg fuel meter. Gear shift is very smooth as mentioned above.   
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality & handling is superb. 
Final Words Considering the parking woes in NCR I planned to buy a compact sedan in the sub 4 meter category and Zest completely fitted the bill and has not disappointed me at all. If you are in the process of buying a sedan then my advise would be to go for zest as no point in buying a Verna or Honda City for that matter. You will end up shelling out a few lacs more for less inner space, a marginal powerful engine and hyped up brands.  
Areas of improvement More Storage space should be provided inside the car.

Exterior I like the exterior look of the car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Spacious interior but the quality of plastic used is bad.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good riding comfort from 3 gear position, 1 st gear to second gear movement takes more time.
Ride Quality & Handling Very comfortable. With reservation to Semi Auto Concept, beccause in bumber to bumber trafic you have to burn extra fuel to keep the car in poition. Not suitable for ladies at all.
Final Words Tata Should not have spoiled this good desighn with semi auto gear system.
Areas of improvement Driving seat should have been made optional with that of XT for XMA model buy paying a few Rs Extra.
Same with Entertainment arrangement. Tata has under estimated a customer going for Automatic option. But I like the car it is really good. If improved and taken more care it will make a hit in the market. The mud entering the engine room from the front tyres is really a matter of concern and to be fixed if not it can cause many problems in the future.

Exterior
 it just looks awesomemine is white cloor xms varient anf looks quite a looker .front facia looks impressive with projector head lamps and chrome details at fog lamps.i can see people peering over for a clear ;ook and thats when you know you are driving one really good looking car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 its satisfactory and feels luxurious with piano finish center console and beige interiors.at the priced i paid ,i can say i got a product well beyond that measure.sound system is good and cabin feels spacious and airy with loads of headroom and legroom.5 members can travel in comfort.i was initially thouht of not having a cetnter armrest as a negetive but later i realised that it can make the middle passenger uncomfortable with stiff back and may be thats why tatas omitted it and now thats ok on practical grounds..
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 engine fells smooth at speeds of 140 and no noise penetrates the cabin.steering feed back is good and feels planted giving confidence to speed further.iam getting 22 on highways and 19 in city driving.gear shifs are smooth cluth is light and feels like driving a petrol car.i hav driven many makes like swift and fiesta.but none has given me this satisfaction.sometimes i feel that blind spot is more particularly steep overs.
Ride Quality & Handling
ride quality is good and even after driving continously 700 kms i felt no fatique or backacahe and the drive was without fuss engaging myself with good music.
Final Words
 i feel happy that i chose a car that could serve for years without giving me headaches and gives pleasure of driving and luxury.
Areas of improvement  
 some clubby holes here and ther and a lamp inside biit ,a folding or split for back seat

Exterior
Exterior design is really good and makes people turn around and look at the car. The projector head lamps, honey comb grill, chrome lining on the doors, led tail lamps and 18 spoke alloy wheels add premium look to the zest. Overall it is a very good design
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Front seats with rugby shoulder design is very comfortable. XMS model comes with height adjustable driver seat and air bags. The rear seats is spacious and three people could be accomodated easily and it has good knee room as well as head room. The dual tone dash board design and speedometer dial gives you a feel of a european spec car. The music system is good with 8 speakers. I havent tried the connect next system with mobile yet
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The 1.3 MJET 89 BHP diesel engine is well tuned to drive in the traffic with minimum gear changes. The drive by wire technology gives good throttle response. The Mid range repsone of the engine is also good though i have not tested at higher rev band of the engine. The AC is effective and good. Gear changes are good though not the very best . I have done only few hundred kms and got an 15 - 16 kmpl in the city with AC On
Ride Quality & Handling
The ride is very good and plush and soaks all the pot holes in the road. The engine noise and road noise is very minimal with all the windows closed.The small steering is easy to hold and maneuver and gives you enough feedback. The 15 inch wheels make good grip with the road and it is stable
Final Words
 Tata zest is good value for money car given its fresh exterior styling, good interior space, good ride/handling and performance compared with the Competition with likes of maruti, honda and hyundai. The mid spec XMS diesel is well equipped with 9Th GEN ABS, Ally wheels, air bags, good connect next and music system for which one have spend an aditional 80,000 to 95,000 INR with same sepcs in the competiton. The quality / fit and finish has also seen a very big imporvement in the Tata Zest.
Overall I would recommend to go for the Tata Zest

Exterior Looks similar to Vista in some angles, but with a mordern touch with projector ligths and DRL.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Steering mounted controls, bluetooth integrated audio system, I find the space quite enough for long drives.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Diesel engine is well mated with tata gear box. No lag even if a small engine, is quick and responsive engine well tuned for city and highway driving.
Ride Quality & Handling CSC and ABS are really helpfull, as my sister is a novice driver I fell save giving the keys of my car.
Final Words Value for money in all terms can compare with Skoda, VW, Hyundai Much better car for Indian roads, Indian driving conditions and for Novice Drivers.
Areas of improvement Uprage the plastics it makes noise if we touch, call center feedback is iritating they will call you twice a day if you dont lift the phone they will call you the same time next day and will atleast take 5 mintues.

Exterior Superly styled exterior, projector headlamps led tail lights, day time running leds, solid built,sporty looks, perhaps the est looking car in its class that is the su 4 meter segment. alloy wheels standard.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Oodles of space the hall mark of any tata car no need to mentio that. interiors very well detailed, finished no cost cutting cheap plastic, body hugging soft seats. Super air conditioning.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Mine is an XMA semi automatic, again first in its class a diesel automatic , the gearbox is a it slow after a long cold start but after a few minutes gears change effortlessly, drive is very easy and non tiring. 
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality again is excellent , drivers position is high giving a clear view, good solid suspension neither too soft nor too stiff, the 16 inch alloys iron out the road very diligently.
Final Words Dont think definitely a must buy.
Areas of improvement Please provide air bags in this top end version, XMA is the highest model but sadly it doesnt have air bags.

Ride Quality & Handling Awesome, very stable and grounded, the CSC works well.
Final Words Must buy car.
Areas of improvement Sometimes in bumber to bumber traffic when auto gear shifts from 2nd to 1st and then your drive in 1st gear, and have to apply brakes, vehicle takes a few second to stop, so not sure if I am not driving right or, but overall good car.

Exterior : roofline ending at C-pillar gives coupe style look. one of the best looking compact sedan. Projector head lamps gives better looks to car. LED guide rings & DRLs(daytime running lights) makes your car stand apart from the crowd. Exterior shut lines are something which you are going to admire. 8-spokes alloy wheels are sexy.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Harman-kardon infotainment system is undoubtedly the best of any car in India. Touch screen is seriously very awesome; Phone connectivity is great ,it provides you handfree features and voice-command-recongnisation feature whch lets you play music track of your choce, change radio station ,control AC, make phone call.
Car is spacious and independent McPherson strut suspension makes very good comfort ride. you don't feel any side roll while turning.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: engine is trusted sourced from fiat quadrajet more powerful than swift dzire, hyundai xcent. There is no turbo-lag felt due to the awesome technology VGT.
fuel economy: 17-18(city); 21-22(highway)
gearbox is smooth.
 
Ride Quality & Handling: awesome ride quality. This car is very demanding, it will ask you to take risk :) go fast coz of it's good powerful engine and good ride quality.It has got corner stability control  which gives you confidence while cornering. You never feel out of power. I have not driven to it's extreme limit but it easily hits 145 kmph very quick but i'm sure it can hit above 165 kmph very easily.
brakes: ABS & EBD features ensures you safer drive. 
 
Final Words : if you are looking to buy a new car then you can give a try for an Indian car. Good car, worth purchasing. It won't disappoint you. 
 
Areas of improvement  : Please provide the inbuilt GPS.
Why is this beautiful car not in black color as well as black alloy wheel.
Experience: i am having very good ecperience with this car. You don't feel any noise inside the cabin.

Exterior Looks awsome if i see the car from behind from a considerable distance its LED tail lamps gives look of mercedes!!!
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors quality and feel of interiors is comparable to a european car.it is loded with features.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Slight turbo lag below 2K rpm but its a overall problem of multijet engine.but as it reaches 2K rpm it picks it up very well.
Ride Quality & Handling NVH levels are awsome,best in segment.belive me there were many instances where i was confused is engine on or off. very spacious and very comfartable ride.
Final Words If anyone looking for a compact sedan it is my sincere request to them to buy zest without any doubt of build quality or after sales service or anything like that.TATA has improved a lot.i have done lots of research.there cannot be a better deal than ZEST in compact sedan segment unless someone wants to go by brand name of honda or maruti suzuki.brand image of tat will also improve in coming year

 good exteriors, got buzz blue colour, really beautiful, needs extra care and maintanance but shines a lot.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 very smooth, silent and clutch free driving, my heal sometimes sore but most of the time driving is relaxing, during auto crawl mode in first gear the car stops after effortful breaking, gear shifting is noticable but you soon get habitual of that, i usually drive my car at 80 kmph and with 100% ac driving minimum average i got was 20.9 kmpl. ofcourse my route is semi highway. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 easy to drive, effortless sterring controls, i need to pay extra attention by moving my head forward and backward while turning or when a lane merge from right side as thick A pillars blind your view. power is always at your feet. 
Final Words 
very good car by tata motors and i am sure with time they will definately improve the product.

Exterior
Exteriors are a refreshing change. Projector headlamps function well at night. Alloys give a luxury touch. Black colored bottom of the rear bumper helps to avoid unnecessary scratches in traffic. Ground Clearance is great and can be used as an all terrain car. Remote control central locking key is provided. Key also contains switch for Follow me Head lamps. Boot is spacious with 390ltrs. Can accomodate 1 full size and 2 mid size bags easily. Overall seems great from outside.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Front Display has 3 modes, where 1st is normal, 2nd shows trip A and 3rd Trip B. It also shows the instant Fuel Efficieny and Avg. Fuel Efficiency. Music system is superb, output is great. 4 speakers and 4 tweeters have been installed in doors. Bluetooth connectivity is good. Once paired, it automatically detects and connects the phone. Steering mounted controls are a big help for people like me who have to attend a lot of calls. The ORVMs can be adjusted electronically and easy to use. Charging socket is also provided along side USB and Aux port. AC is very effective and cools the cabin in a short span of time. Car is spacious with ample room in rear. Tilt steering is also an added advantage. Cabin storage space is a big disadvantage. Other than a cup holder, which is also not too deep, there is no other place to keep your wallet, mobile phone, fuel slips, change etc. A small space is given below the handbrake, which isn't that adequate. A storage tray is provided below front passenger seat. Glove box is decent sized. Space given in doors is also very narrow. Got an armrest installed for storage purpose and comfort.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Fiat 90ps Engine is responsive. You can snail in traffic even in 3rd gear with speed around 20km/hr. Have driven 1000kms so far so can't comment on fuel efficiency but the digital indicator has been showing 17km/l for quite some time now. Gearbox is slick and doesn't get stuck. Though when you increase the speed, one can feel slight jerk in gear pushing it backwards as if inertia is acting on it. Otherwise its fun to drive. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride quality is decent. Suspension is not that smooth over potholes and bad roads but does a decent job. I drove Linea before Zest, so lack of smooth ride quality can be felt. Handling is great. Clutch is quite soft for a diesel engine. Steering is also responsive, light and can be operated with just one hand.  
Final Words
Its big move from Tata with Zest. Refreshing interiors and exteriors, comfortable ride add to the pleasure of driving this car. Can be considered as a good alternative to Amaze, which I didn't find that Amaze-ing. With Zest, Tata deserves another chance in this segment. 
Areas of improvement  
Cabin storage space needs to be seriously looked at. Armrests in doors could have been used to add some space. Also I will suggest not to buy car from Autovikas, Moti Nagar, Delhi. They have made false commitments at every stage of service delivery. Also for smalleset of issues, such as fixing number plate, they take an hour's time. Sales team is highly casual and doesn't bother how customer is feeling. Once you book the care, they don't give attention to you.

The company has taken a step in the right direction with the Zest, which not only looks attractive but among the best styled compact sedans available in India today
Exterior Look is too good and lights give you premium look 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Dashboard and console is very luxurious and you will feel that you are sitting in car like Audi.
The infotainment system developed by Harman is a flush fitting unit with some unique features that definitely set the Zest apart from everything else in the segment
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Performance is good , but mileage can be bit better(nt yet checked completely).
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is too smooth, We have good ground clearance and bootspace as well.
Final Words Finally, an impressive product from Tata with best-in-class features, space and comfort, But overall its value for money, if one wants premium car with lower cost ,has to go for ZEST. No need of second opinion , Go with ZEST.
Areas of improvement Mileage and front look can be improved, so that from fron it doesnt resemble tata old car.

Exterior Very nice and bold outlook design in this segment comparing to other brand companies
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very nice music system of harman with eight speakers, switch controls on steering wheel, space management is done quite efficiently.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is very good, also the car pick up is excellent.
Ride Quality & Handling My personal opinion about this car is...till date the car had run about 18000 plus km (purchased in December 2014). I have done two times car services by now and no technical problems in maintenance. I have just tried speeding to check how the car behaves at 160 km/hr speed on pune solapur highway and to my surprise the car was very steady and firm on road. Wheel stearing and gear shifting is very smooth, so personally I feel ride quality is quite satisfying to me.
Final Words A good value for money in this segment car.
Areas of improvement Should improve on fuel economy, needs bottle holders & Sun glasses holder and improvement in wind screen wipers & water sprinklers timing.

Full Review 
Exterior Good looks with projection headlamp. Looks solid with good height and width
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) First of all it has very very silent cabin. being diesel model noise level inside cabin is very very low and having music system on you do not know whether engine is running or not. this is the great achievement by Tata. Amasing music system added with 8 speakers lot of functions. Sun visors need to feel solid as they are to flimsy to hand. Tata should go for twin shell or EPP sunvisors. What i am missing is place to keep water bottle and mobile, two essential things for travel. Seats are good and support well. Overall best package inside. Display provide you with lot of information
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox So far driven only 900 Km in about 20 days so to early to comment on engine performance. Automatic Gear changing is good but sometime you feel lag while gear is being changed. I am getting 13 KM/Lit in City and more than 20 KM /Lit for long drive (I travelled to Mumbai) which is not at all bad.
Ride Quality & Handling I checked Honda City, Hyundai Accent, Maritu Ciaz, Honda Amaze and Tata Zest and I found Tata Zest best in this. suspensions clearly beat Honda city. Best performance of ABS and corner stability.
Final Words Fantastic package to buy if you are going for automatic varient. 4 lacs cheaper than Skoda rapid, 3 Lacs cheaper than Honda city, 2 lcas cheaper than Ciaz and cheaper than petrol automatic versions of Amaze & Axcent. So go for it without thinking.
Areas of improvement As mentioned above, should have sotrage space, light in boot (Boot is covered in black carpet and usually all city parkings are underground) so how can you see? I also miss air bags and Cruze control but that will add to lot of cost.

Full Review 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I have driven around 2500 KMS, but the milege is just 14 in city and 15.5 in High Way. I am very Much worried. This is a very poor milege for a Disel Car.
I have driven arouns 1500 KMPL only on Highways. (Pondicherry, Yercaud, Yelagiri and Hogenakal). I saw some reviews saying that they get 17 in City and 20 -21 KMPL in Highway. So somebody please say if there is some fault in my vechicle in particular.
Milege Calculated by - Filled Tank, drove a certain KMS, Filled my Tank again and Divided the total KMS driven by No of Liters pourded to fill the tank again. And my average Kmps that shows in the Odometer also matches perfectly. Some body please advice.
Audio system by Harman is mind blowing, 8 speakers in built make it mind blowing.The AC is uniform and chilling within few minutes, controls on steering are easy to access.

Full Review 
Exterior Good exterior with nice detail lines on side. additional detailing like drl's, chrono rings, LED tail lamps all look par with competitors. built quality is really strong.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is the best thing in the car. nicely done dual tone dashboard with features like touch sceen infotainment and reverse sensors, controls on steering, speed sensing audio system and EPAS steering wheel.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is great as once the turbo kicks in you will enjoy its boost. fuel economy-- giving me 21-22 kmpl on highways and 17-18 kmpl in city. gearbox is nice and smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling As always the ride quality is top notch. rear passenger will love the comfort at back seats. handling is superb as the EPAS steering wheel provide you more confidence on steep turns as well as during high speeds.
Final Words Great car to own. definitely better than rest of its competitors. just in case of xcent as xcent supports more features but it has better engine and better lighting and better everything.
Areas of improvement Committment, sales and service otherwise no issue, no offense.

Exterior
Projector head lamps, day time running lights, led tail lams, front & back fog lamps and stunning eye catching looks.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Good quality plastic, rich interiors, best segment first harman infotainment system with 4 speakers, 4 tweeters, Fully automatic climate control, touch screen, voice recognition, steering mounted control, Bluetooth connectivity, speed sensing auto door locks, seat belt reminder, driver seat height adjustment, tilt steering, steering auto return function with Epas, comfortable shoulder rug by sheets, power windows and remote locking with foldable key.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine performance impressive, I have driven 650 Km in single stretch with 100% AC, average speed of 80km/hr I have managed 22Km/l.
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride quality is very good and handling is very smooth.
 
Final Words
It is the best sedan in this segment and VFM vehicle. on roads observed everybody is interstingly watching vehicle. some examples iam quoting here.
1) while filling fuel petrol bunk lot of other vehicle owners enquiring.
2) while ordering seat covers and accessories shop owner interestingly enquiring.
3) Iam following school bus to overtake in bus small kids quoting loudly super car.
4) Till date I have competed 1500 Kms in 10 days period without any problems and any negative comments from my well wishers, colleagues , friends and neighbours.
Iam proud to be owner of Tata Zest QJT XT red colour.

Nil, why some customers are quoting facing some problems I am sorry for that but this problems are not applicable to overall tata zest cars rinning on road. Tata customer care service for zest is very responsive hope they will resolve those issues shortly.

Exterior LOOKS AWESOME IN THIS SEGMENT. HEAD LAMPS AND TAIL LAMPS ARE PLACED ATTRACTIVELY.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) AS IN ANY OTHER TATA CAR A GOOD LOT OF INTERIOR SPACE.BETTER THAN EVEN THE HYUNDAI VERNA ANOTHER VERY GOOD CAR.SUSPENSIONS ARE HARD AND CAN TAKE ANY AMOUNT OF BAD ROADS. THE CAR INTERIORS ARE VERY NEW AND GOODS. IF WE WANT TO TAKE THE BEST AND THE WORST INTERIORS THE WORST SRE THOSE RENAULT/NISSAN ALL CARS WHICH HAVE THE SHABBIEST INTERIORS. IN THIS SEGMENT THIS CAR HAS ONE OF THE BEAT INTERIORS.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox FUEL AVERAGE LONG 20KMPL AT SPEEDS OF AROUND 100-120.LOCAL MILAGE NOT CHECKED. I HAVE DRIVEN AROUND 4500 KMS WITHIN A MONTH AND HENCE THE REVIEW.
Ride Quality & Handling THE RIDE QUALITY IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THGE SEGMENT. THIS CAR IS RELATIVELY SILIENT AS COMPARED TO AMAZE. DOOR NOISE IS PETRIFYING AND HORRIBLE. TATA HAS REALLY IGNORED SUCH AN IMPORTANT ASPECT.
Final Words THE BEST CAR. HIGHLY ADVISED TO BUY.
Areas of improvement THEY SHOULD WORK ON THE DOOR NOISE, BOTTLE HOLDERS ETC.

Full Review 
Based on many review finally purchased on 24-10-2014 XMS desile varient, 
 Exterior: Looks very good and feels like big sedan.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): In interior TATA has done super job. look, space ,sitting comfort are sooo nice.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Here starts the thing , that tata offered  more power but comparingly i didnt feel that, in turn  i feel it is underpowered than my old ford figo and swift. I disappointed with power. gear box feels smooth but get stuck some times . fuel consumption also not good i am getting 12 to 13 kms in city . 
 
Ride Quality & Handling: not so good ,body rolls in every small humps suspenssion is also not up to the mark. and  this car get strain to reach 100+ speed .  steering wheel rod  touches the clutch pedal when pedal pressed ,it is so disturbing. I had complained in Manikbag showroom at Hubli regarding this but i didnt find good technician there.
 
Final Words: for look and for biginners it is  nice but it is not so impressive for those who already driven many cars .   
 
Areas of improvement  : TATA should deliver the car only after checking the vehicle in every ascept . otherwise a small misteke also make the customer unliking the TATA .
We r Indians and bought this car to encourage india but still they have to work hard

Full Review 
Driving a automatic car is very very easy. The car looks very good except for the front grill it reminds me of indica(taxi) daylight looks gud and the tail lamp lights are great.would have loved a body coloured lower bumber.
The leg room is great and the interior has a great quality and finish. Would have been better if leather seats were availble. Infotainmnet is mind blowing with great sound effects, navigation from navimaps with four pro guidance purchases free, picture and video playback as well. Would have been best if reverse camera could be integrated into the infotainment system.
Engine works fine. Easy to handle and overtaking is hassel free. Mileage started to improve now 14 but car is purchased three weeks before so its good and it will improve. Easy to corner at high speeds. Speed increases at a good rate. Just a small lag when shifting from first to second.
Could have added a camera for reverse parking, body colour bumber, leather seats.

Full Review 
Exterior: Excellent in exterior in comparision with it's rivals. No other car gives fog lamps, ORVM lights and chrome finishing in the mid variant. Dull side is the guage of the material used. According to me the body should have been little more stronger. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Superb features such as driver info, steering mounted audio controls, bluetooth pairing, good space on rear seats that can accomodate 3 people easily. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Don't feel the power/punch of the 90 ps power. There is lag on engine. Clutch is not smooth enough after running 800 kms. Fuel economy is appreciable. Mechanical parts are not upto the mark. Plastic lid for containers under the hood are of poor quality. 
Ride Quality & Handling: Punch of the 90ps power lacking. Not bad but of mediocre. Tata, you have to work out a little bit more. 
Final Words: At it's best possible for the money spent. 
Areas of improvement: Body guage should improve, quality of parts under the bonnet should improve, parcel tray on the rear should have little more room. Could have accomodated air bag in the mid-variant.

Exterior :- Front design of zest is much improved. Tail of vehicle looks awsome with LED tail lamps. Excellent ground clearance.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Zest is fully loaded with important features such as projector head lamps and world class HARMAN music system. As a TATA vehicle you dont have to worry about a space. it has more than enough leg room boot space, excellent front and rear seats.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 
i have driven this vehicle 5000 km in a span of month and it is giving me average of 23 km/l highway and 21 km/l in city. It has a perfect heart with 1.3 ltr. quadrajet diesel engine
 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Most of my drive in zest is in rural area of maharashtra. believe me it has perfect suspension in built in car. 
Final Words
 Best  sub 4 mtr. sedan to buy. TATA is back in action.
Areas of improvement  
 TATA just have to market themselves and need to change mind set of customer. ZEST is technically best car in this segment

Exterior Looks good. The front grill needs a face-lift. Top end version should have auto folding side mirrors.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very good interior space. The top end version should come with built in GPS.This available in much less priced vehicles these days. The info screen should be a little more bigger.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I just had a long trip. Covered about 600 kms in one day. On Bengaluru-Mysuru highway, I got 23.8 kms pl. That's just wondeful. And overall for the entire trip I got 21.6kms pl. This was sometimes with bumper to bumper traffic and AC most of the time. I took delivery of the vehicle a month back and so far I covered 1200 kms.
Ride Quality & Handling The ride quality is very good. Handling is also very good. The engine runs smooth and gears engage without any fuss.Though my dealer had said that the car has 4+1 gear and found that it has 5+1 gear!
Final Words It's a very good product from the Tatas. Hope the co will improve on this further so that customers can taking a liking for Made in India Tata Cars.
Areas of improvement The co should provide more storage space inside the cabin. The dash board colour combination can be made more appealing. Built in GPS with a wider screen is a must.

Exterior
Looks good from outside. Holds its ground against the looks of other sedans - also due to the fact that it is less spotted on roads than dezire or amaze, which are more common.  
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Very spacious from the inside. 5 adults can fit comfortably. Leg room is better than dezire or amaze. A/c is also good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine and gearbox are smooth. Though the pick-up is better in amaze - but is also has 1498cc engine. I am getting average of 20-22/kmpl consistently.  
Ride Quality & Handling
 Very smooth ride, though not very confidant in sharp turns. I drove 600 kms in a stretch and was not at all tired by the ride. Handles well in high speed. Max speed I touched is 160 on Hyderabad-Bangalore highway.
Final Words
I wanted to wait for Ford Aspire but went for Zest considering the maintenance cost and features you are getting in the base model, such as body coloured door handles and OVRM.
Areas of improvement  
Only complaint I found is that there is absoluetly no space for bottle holders inside, which is necessary for long journeys.

Zest has very attractive interiors. With projector Lamps, Day time running lights and LED backlight, it is beautiful.
Smae is true with interiors. Excellent space, both at front and back, Driver's seat height adjustment, Auto climate control and excellent music system, it too good.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Too Good. After driving 7500+ Kilometers, I am really happy with the performance. In city Conditions, my car gives me a mileage of 20+KMPL and on Highways its performance has been OUTSTANDING. I routinely get a mileage 25+ kmpl that include traffic holds and driving in hills. I got best mileage of 27.7 kmpl on Delhi-Chandigarh Highway. 
Thank You TATA.
 ZEST has excellent Ride Quality & Handling is so smooth. I have driven the car in Hilly areas with steep narrow roads. 
 I am really really happy with the performance of ZEST. Touchwood.
 
I don't know Tatas bottle holders in the cabin. Another area of improvement is mud/dust getting into engine compartment.

Milage is not soo good as they said.Am getting 15 on hihgway and 11 in city. It has a Fiat puntos Engine.. Hence adviceable.. Overall is good. TATA must really come out of giving a feel of Indicas look. Indicas are mostly taxis and it doest give you the fun of having a persoanal car. The zest front looks more like a TATA vista. And TATA vista more looks like TATA indiaca. Hence, Zest looks like Indica.
Clutch is not a smart clutch. They have loaded the features. Which is good. But at the end of the day, OVMR and smart clutch must have been added to it. If the price could have gone a lil more higer. May be another 10 k is also ok. If ovmr and smart clutch was there, it would have been a complete car.

IT is really a good car from TATA group. THis is my second car from TATA. CAR IS MORE SPACIOUS, AUDIO system is more effective. really enjoing the long drive.
I can say this is really one of the best product from TATA. suitable for our roads. No need to worry for speed breakers. 
seating also more comfortable. Really worth for money.
BUT THE TATA DEALERS ARE NOT SHOWING ANY DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR SERVICE. AS USUAL, LEAST CUSTOMER CARE.
EXCHAGING MY OLD CAR, I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM KRISHNAGIRI TRUE SAI DEALER OUTLET.more than 20 days over but I COULD NOT GET MY RECEPIT OR BILL FOR THE OLD CAR SALE. 
I WENT TO KRISHNAGIRI to MEET THE GEN MANAGER @ SHOWROOM. BUT FOR CURTACY HE DID t COME OUT FROM HIS CABIN.
 REGISTRATION  number I CAN ABLE TO GET  FROM SOME MEDIATOR. BUT THE DEALERS CHARGE FOR REGISTRATION and not even called me to say the car number after registred.
I ADVICE,WHEN YOU BUY new car DONT FORGET TO ASK THE  CLIPS FOR YOUR FRONT NUMBER PLATE. BECAUSE IN MY CASE it WAS NOT THERE. AFTER A LONG STRUGGLE I GOT IT. ANY ORDINARY CLIPS WONT MATCH YOUR NUMBER PLATE.
OTHERWISE CAR IS VERYGOOD. NEED LOT OF DEVLOPMENT IN SERVICE only. BECAUSE TODAY MOST OF THE CAR DEALERS ARE CUSTOMER FRIENDLY AND FAST IN SERVICE.
IF THIS IS CONTINUING FOR TATA, NO USE OF introducing GOOD PRODUCT in MARKET.

Exterior The exterior was so much improved when compared to other siblings of tata, but could be better when compared to other brands. The ground clearence is awesome. You'll never have to fear when you see those heavy bumps on the road.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interior is superior than any other sedans in this class in quality, comfort, and elegance except which there is no bottle (1 ltr) stand anywhere.  The engine sounds a bit, but not much audible inside upto 2500 RPM. The Harman audio and support system is awesome. It has everything in it. Touch screen could be more better.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox As you already know that the petrol engines give a performace than diesel, TATA ZEST diesel engine also gives a better quality of ride. It has a good pick-up (lesser than Swift ). Performance - wise it doesn't win the race with maruthi suzuki swift VDi. In this segement also its better than its siblings but not when compared with maruthi. Gearbox is smooth, fuel economy indicator shows that average milleage was 15 KM/ltr only. I rode upto 250 KMS till now. Hope it gets improved in future.
Ride Quality & Handling The ride quality is above average. Good control of ride and handling is excellent. Inside the car, every thing is very quiet and awful. It has very heavy suspensions which eats all the shocks and gives you a smooth and pleasant ride.
Final Words Improved in each and every corner and the car performs very well. But the sales and sevice department are vey sluggish in promoting this product. Definatley you'll never regret for investing your money on Tata ZEST.
Areas of improvement The alloy wheels shown in the test ride are not same as the one that are produced currently. The 8 Spoke alloy wheels looks very elegant than the current 20 Spoked ones.

Exterior Good but dynamics when compared to Honda Amaze is weak.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) No features like reverse sensor, touch screen, Seat height adjustment. Space and comfort is OK.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Really Bad.
Ride Quality & Handling I purchased xma last week, and driven 400 kms in city. I have not at all felt happy with the riding comfort. though I have 25 years experience in driving, I faced lot of problems in city riding. Lot of jerks in gear box made me fee bad. I wouldn't have purchased if I went to test drive. Sujuki Celerio Automated Manual transmission is well fitted in that car. 
Final Words Please don't purchase XMA. XT or XM Diesel is far far better to ride.
Areas of improvement Gear box should be reset. Engine noise is very high when compared to Manual transmission. Dash board is nice but fabric seats are looking cheep and colour of seats are to be light. No day light LED are given. Some noise is coming from gear rod. I can't imagine why XMA is given with less features  and less important.

Full Review 
Exterior Looks ok, I liked the first version, the most. Chrome look makes it look little funky and not classy.
Headlights and fog lamp are better now, shape from the front is good. No change from side or back in looks.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good things about interior:- Dash board is amazing with dual colors, good displays, nice grip on steering (Leather cover would have made it awsome though), Front seats are spacious and confortable, ride is comfortable since suspensions are very good. Handling for ORVMs electrically, is really a big plus, power windows, child lock etc. are good. 12 V socket are at adequate places. Sound quality is very good in the music system provided.
Bad things about interior:- Space on the back seat is very bad, three people can't sit comfortably, specially in long journey its very bad. AC is not very fast cooler, my Tata car before this used to get cool withing seconds. More features like blue tooth phone compatibility and streaming could have been provided.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is awsome, I have not seen such a pick up in disel engines. It is really a pleasure to drive this machine above 2000RPM. Fuel economy is another reason that will give joy to Indian customers. I m getting 20KMPL in city with AC on and heavy traffic.
Milage is 25 KMPL on highway, not driven too much though, I will update this review once I drive longer on highways.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is really good suspensions are superb, don't feel like a boat ride on bumpy roads. Handling is very good. Electrically asisted power steering gives amazing control.
Final Words If you have a small family (4 + 1 child), then its a very good car for you. Its a combination of style, luxury and also light on pocket (fuel economy). All in all a very good car.
Areas of improvement More space can be provided in back seat and in boot. More features can be provided in this price as the competitors are already giving more than that.

Exterior I liked new headlamps and fog lights are changed with added chrome and the wheels are so good Now. Bored from old dzire look this new version of sedan rocked.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are good .. space is quite sufficient and 5 can easily fit here. And boot space is so large. Coming to the comfort .. Seats can get better.
Engine Performance fuel Economy and Gearbox The thing which wow ed was the Mileage... 22 in the city was great and gearbox is quick and soft and engine's power is less which should not be any concern if we are getting amazing Mileage.
Ride Quality & Handling There are few vibrations after 60KM/Hr but i found it was due to my wheels which I will change after some time and get alloys in change. Steering is responsive and best among all the maruti cars except Ciaz.
Final Words Car is awesome and more confident now with stylish looks and performance is good. I will definitely suggest to buy.
Areas of improvement Didn't liked the music system and speakers.. And noise can be reduced.

Full Review 
Mine is the VDi version of Dzire, have drove around 10k+ kmsw with some long frives around Delhi. Really enjoyed the car.

Exterior
The car looks pretty small sedan. Have chosen the glistering grey colour, it has, chrome garnish is apt at required locations. Fog lapms on VDi is perfectly included in this variant. Good built of the car, runs smooth on highways.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Car is perfectly comfortable, spacious for small family with apt luggage for weekend drives. The older version though has less features, but is acccurately minimalistic. There is CD, Radio, Aux and USB players, you need no more than this for weekend drives or daily drives. Yes there could be inclusion of the remote boot lid opener, some steering mounted controls will make this car hot cake for the most sold version (VDi). AC too is quite powerful, you can be well comfortable ini the Delhi / NCR summers.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Horses below the hood are nicely packed, 75 BHP on this 1248cc Multijet engine is perfect for this notchback. I'm happy with the economy of 22.5 with AC on road and can also jerk though the city traffic. The gear box is very smooth (I have driven some tough gear boxes too.). You can zip in through and not struggle to find the right gear on the right situations on Delhi /NCR roads
Ride Quality & Handling
This is area is the best part of it, absolutely smooth ride quality, cushy suspensions. 
Final Words
Perfect car and perfectly placed in the right segment. Small perfect family car.
Areas of improvement  
Missed the arm rest to the driver seat required, though aware that its difficult to fit it, but still essential for long drives.

Full Review 
Exterior The looks are not the best you can get at this price (as you can buy an entry level model of verna with this money), but not at all bad as well (It might end up being second or third based on exterior looks).
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interiors of the car are as inviting as non other car's (in this price) would be. The features are awesome, with navigation system and a good responsive touch screen. This is the most spacious and comfortable car one can fetch in this price range. In fact, the car's rear seat's recine angle is said to be more comfortable than the Mercedes Benz S-Class.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine is a great performer and one can easily clock 150 kmph, if the road allows you to. Also, the car gives no lags in performance even if the AC is kept to its fullest. The economy might be somewhat around 18 to 20 overall. The gearbox is swift and its quite easy to shift the gears.
Ride Quality & Handling The ride quality and handling is a differentiating factor for this car and the others at this price. Its great to be at the driver's seat. The steering is as much responsive as it should be. Even the suspension is worth a praise.
Final Words - Overall, with all the good features and one or two odd negatives, the car stands to be a great value for money and a must buy if you have 8 lacs to spare.
Areas of improvement As mentioned in the cons, the NVH insulation needs to be improved. And seeing the size of the car, a rear parking sensor should be added. Also, because of the space inside the cabin, the car seriously requires rear AC vents (which are now available in Xcent).

Exterior Body Design could have been better. Needs to take a leaf from Ciaz which is bult on the same engine. If improved. Can fetch a better price. Fog Lamp Strips on front bumper should be made available on all models. Also rub rails on all models.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good. Can improve by having split A/C. Need slight better door pockets. Pl. provide front Arm rest on all models.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent!!! can you improve the fuel efficiency??? Gear shift is smooth, infact its a drivers' delight.
Ride Quality & Handling Very nice. Performs exceedingly well on Ghat roads. Excellent road grip.
Final Words PL. improve the styling on looks. Specially the front facia. Please do not stop producing this beautiful car.
Areas of improvement The looks on the front facia, Engine hood. Improve headlight and tail light assembly looks. Please market this car better.

Exterior
 good looks, specially the front and the side angle is very nice. the new headlights is quite awesome too.
ground clearance is bit of a problem when you are 5 people with some luggage. big road humps is a problem.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 very comfortable seating. long drives are no more a pain. the driving is very comfortable. with lumbar support, driver's seat is just perfect. finish quality of the dashboard is worth the money, may be improved a bit.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 quite powerful engine, fuel economy may be improved a bit, gearbox is smooth too. service of the car is a very smooth process as well.  with the air conditioner on,engine power drops a bit.
Ride Quality & Handling
 smooth drive, doesnt feel like you are driving such a big car. with height adjustable steering and driver seat, driving comfort is at a new high.
Final Words
 Complete value for money
Areas of improvement  
 better fuel efficiency,

Hello,
1. Don't you inform customers when the extended warranty is void? Concorde service people told me that extended warranty is valid on July 2015 and replaced the glow plug. Why you keep on reiterating?
2. Do you have any proof to support your statement, that concorde motors have checked this issue? I need to see this. If so what did they check and how was this concluded stating nothing needs to be done. Concorde engineer had told me that this is a common issue with Manza and they didnt check this.
3. This doesn't answer my query. Why do you need to remind me that this was a test drive car when complaints arises? I didn't had mentioned anything about the test drive car in our discussion.
4. On 16th around 6:30pm during our conversation you had communicated that turbo issue will be checked on 17th? Do you admit this? So how can you say that this was checked on 16th? Concorde service manager had called you back while leaving to have a discussion with me. Or did you checked this issue after 6:30pm ?
5. From where can I know that the extended warranty of my car is void?
6. Do you have any proofs to support that they have checked this issue? Concorde engineer had told me that this is a common issue with Manza and they didnt check this.
7. Now you are saying things differently. On 16th you had told that service should have done by 12 months after 3rd service. Now you are saying that it should be done by 24 months or 30000 kms after purchase. Can you please clarify which is correct? Do you have any confusions or do you need to check this again with your manager?
If this is 24 months then it should be scheduled on April 2015. I had clearly told the reason for not doing the service on April. Also when I told this you said that if it was a gap of 3 months then you would have replaced the turbo in extended warranty. You are repeatedly changing your words in the presence of your colleagues and managers.
Jibin,
I think you are seeing this loop of mails. Can you please clarify with Krishnan about this and get back to me on this?

Exterior Gets dented easily by small stone chips flying on the road. Back side looks cheap. Front and side look is good. Colors are good and lively. alignment is poor and awakword.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Excellent space and comfortable to drive. Feachers are good but not reliable and have frequent problems. Fabric on the doors look ugly.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Poorly built quality, needs frequent replacement of parts, average 1 visit every 1000KM is must. I have visited 21 times in 2 years for replacement of parts/ service.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality and handling is good and impressive. THe vehicle is very steady on the road. Seating is comfortable. Has lot of blind spots hence you need to get used to it.
Final Words Very unreliable (unlike other tata products). Poor quality of parts. May be OK as a taxi.
Areas of improvement All areas needs to be imporoved, But most importantly, Quality and reliability. MY FINAL WORDS- BETTER TO AVOID, GO FOR A MARUTI OR HUNDAI

Exterior This car is one of the best looking. Love the front looks and side ones. I was enjoying the feel how most of the crowd on road was checking my new Club class Manza (VX) by gazing it. Windscreen / metallic body and front lights / fog lamps are nice. Now the car is coming with roof top antenna which is adjustable. Awsome colors availability.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) These are the best avaialble with Manza;
Bluetooth connectivity (up to 5 i think) / music system (with CD player) / Navigation (GPS) / touchscreen controls / plastic quality and glass quality / appealing dashboard color scheme and displays at right place with nice steal and chromium / internal looks and feel / "SPACE" to accomodate /  seat fabric and belt quality / stearing mounted controls with glitch free power window controls / clarity of the voice (with respect to music and bluetooth connectivity through handphone) / adjustable stearing wheel / long drive relief notch for driver seat / real big front drawer / AC;
Engine sound is much reduced if we compare to old Manza versions. Cabin is pretty quite. Do we need anything else? I am so satisfied with these!
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I purchased my car in Hubli (KA) where I live in Bangalore. I drove back to Bangalore on the same day I got the delivery, control was awesome on highways and within the city. Enjoyed the long drive (430 KM's) and got 24.5 Kms / Ltr (diesel). The quadrajet engine was so smoot and glitch free, turning radius / shock absorbers / ride quality were really nice.
Without 1st service till date ( 1st service is on 8th Jab 13), car is performing very well. Within the Bangalore city (you must be aware of traffic jams here and road quality) I am getting 19.5 Km/Ltr;
Engine parformance is superb, its QuadraJet from FIAT boss.
I have a single complaint for the gear shifting which is not quite smooth, I believe after the 1st service this issue will get fixed.
Ride Quality & Handling Super! handling is very smooth, I just feel as i am driving a hatchback. Very stable on roads.
Final Words I AM SATISFIED. What all I feel is I have managed to purchase a car which has ample features and a real value for money. We can't suspect TATA's ability with diesel vehicles.
Areas of improvement Looks, still there is some space to improve, Still the engine sound can be redused? not sure but TATA ppl can take this advice .

Ride Quality & Handling Good.
Final Words Seat belt is not comfirt.Etios is the only mid-segment car in India to have passed the crash test.
Areas of improvement Engine power.metal guage.seat belt position is not comfirtable it makes some pain to my neck. speedo metre position is not satisfactory. a good speedo metre is in innpva.tyre height is not satisfactory if we use nissan sunnys tyre it gives better driving comfort and sporty driving but a little suffering in fuel efficiency. I am using this car from 2011 newly purchased and i am very satisfied with this cars perfomance driving comfort and my dealer is nippon toyotta .they provide me very good after serviece.maintanance is cost is too low .on every 10000kms serviece i got a charge only between rs 2200 to rs 3500 only comparitively very low.engine sound is little high.and if engine power is upgrade to 80hp it is more comfirtable with 6 passengers and get more power in high range areas.breaking gear shifting and steering wheel is very smooth and giving more easy driving in long journeys too. i lov this vehicle and thanking toyotta engineers for making this good car.

Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality is very gud i Drove at speed of 120 KM/Hr it has good stability on Road thanks to 15 inch wheel.
Final Words I would recommend to every one who are not much enthuist to too much interior and want perfromance stability Just go for it. I took Drive test of almost 15 Cars. But Toyota Simply Rocks!!!!!
Areas of improvement Lack little bit of Turbo but very little but once it gains speed it will not dissapoint you. Simply awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Also got awesome deal on Toyota. Pls go for toyota protect Insurance it might be costly but worth it.

Exterior Nice outlook with just two body arches, smiling grill and hexagonal boot(which is quiet big too).
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Seats are pretty comfortable, good space, quiet powerful AC, good music sound and nice chubby holes all around making a family trip comfortable. Morehow should give arches in back seat(which is quiet flat) and the armrest.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is the great plus point. Even the noise it produces makes energetic.. As you push hard you feel car running forward ahead preety fast. Pickup is plus point 0 to 100 in 12-14sec. And when you give a down shift it gives a power punch.. And all power comes in early 3800rpm. And the sound when you push hard is pleasent. Fuel efficiency is 15-17kmpl in city and easy 20+kmpl on highway on AC.
Ride Quality & Handling Great ride quality. Car is pretty stable. No feel of body roll. Sterring is awesome. Better than hyundai suzuki honda any and so is gear box.
Final Words Great car. Both for family and for personal drive. Dont go paper written 68ps

Final Words If improves the after sales service then can think of buying a toyota for second time if not will not buy or recommend any one.
Areas of improvement I have purchased etios gd from harsha toyota hyd in march 2014. they dont deliver your vehicle on your convinent time or the time which they have promised. it can be delayed for a day to but not surprise in it.when you want to buy accessories then they will recommend or take you to the d-graded accessories. and they will give dupilicate accessories as complimenrty which they have promised at the time of delivery that to after a long follow up after months. the sales gm is very worst who makes false promises. now coming to service the customer care manager at kondapur and service manager at lb nagar gouda are the worst people who says please dont buy toyota and bother us. if u give ur car for interior cleaning then they will deliver your car with water in it and then they will blame the delivery driver for that. they could rectify the seat hight adjustment issue since an year. there are some people who helped me in some instances. But most of the harsha toyota is worst in customer services and some thmes they say it is not BMW to give you high class service for the money. They make you to buy a package called usmile but the exact meaning behind it is ucry wesmile. at the end they will appolizise you and they wiil say this will not repeat again and will give discounts and extra benifits in your next purchse. but the time comes to new purchase they will say this the best we can do and ntg els we can do. but the prices are abit high with them when compaerd to other delars.they will not give u any thg. finaly they are the big cheaters in the market.

Exterior
I bought an Etios VXD (diesel top-end) in Dec 2014, its a facelift version with a changed grill design! I am satisfied with the exteriors since I was more inclined for a simple yet elegant family car not much bothering about curves!
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
The new Greige interiors with a sporty leather steering wheel is perfect. Match it with Greige leather seat covers and you will feel luxury at its best!
Other new features like bluetooth, AUX-in, 6 speakers, chrome gear knob and AC vents, side door wooden finish make u feel pampered for!
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
A little low on power and pick-up, but I somehow love the diesel engine sound!!! Its feels a little mature and good to me.
The engine noise is zero or less in cabin!! Thats another added feature in the facelift version. Gear shift is very smooth and segmental.
Ride Quality & Handling
Excellent! No issues with ride quality!
Final Words
Case 1: Etios VXD - 10 lacs (Full entry sedan) vs. Amaze - 9.5 lacs (Compact sedan) vs. Dzire - 9 Lacs (compact sedan) : Why not buy a full sedan for almost the same price and a Toyota brand?
Case 2: Etios VXD (10 lacs) vs. Honda City (13 lacs) vs. Hyundai Verna (13.5 lacs): For a working class family man, it makes sense to spend 10 lacs and buy a top end diesel car comparable to size of other premium sedans like City or Verna!!! Think!!!
Areas of improvement  
Power: A littlelow, should be atleast 90-100 BHP!

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Worst Mileage no Consisitancy. Engine quality is superb as compared to its compititors and can even give higher end 10Lac cars a run for their money.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Good.
Final Words
 Good vehicle but very poor mileage of 12-16 Kmpl on Highways and 10 Kmpl inside city. Whenever approached Servive Centre first they said I will get 25Kmpl and later they said after 2000 Kms I can get But even after 5000 kms I am still getting 12-16 Kmpl only. The fuel meter(Digital) has 10 divisions but there again it is not propperly designed How do I get to reach Toyota Technical executives. I would be very happy if a Toyota person meets me in this regard.

Dear Sir,
We are suffering till today for following:
1. Car is without number plate (No documents of RTO submitted).
2. No mats in the car and.
3. Zero Depreciation Insurance not given whereas we had paid for it.
4. No account of payments given.
5. They are not taking any phone calls now.
Other things as mentioned earlier are also their which are out of reconciliation. My detailed mail to Customer care remained unattended so attached below.
Dear Sir, Further to mail below we are to inform you that today also we tried to contact both Mr. Pramod Singh +91842583XXXXXX and Ms. Anju +919664XXXXXX more than 10 times but both are not answring the calls. To our surprise we received a call from +912241XXXXXX that our number plat has been made but they do not have any person to deliver.The person (a girl) called refused to disclose her name. She was not aware about the car mats. Your immediate intervention is required otherwise we will be boud to move the consumer court.  Dear Sir, We are to inform further that the dealer's representative had sent the vehicle to our residence without proper documents i.e. 1. No car Number and/or No RTO documents 2. We had paid additioanl Insurance premium of about Rs. 7,700/ for Zero Depreciation but only a normal Insurance policy had been taken. 3. Receipt of amount paid and relevant bills of amount appropriated not given Car had been sent with a new driver without any company representativ. Further we are told that the car can not be used without car number so if you want to use then use it at your risk. They have not given essential asseories worth Rs. 3,000/ like mats etc as mentioned in price list whereas they promised us to give the same without any additional charges as part of December booking discount. Their are so many other issues in the car which are unable to state in the mail. Hence we have not accepted the delivery of the car as a good delivery. They told us that they will call us today but till now no phone call received they have switched off their mobiles.   You are advised to take action on priority and look in to this.  Dear Sir, We have booked a Renault Scala desile car at your VASHI NEW Mumbai Branch Contact persons'mobile number is 09664XXXXXX Ms. We have booked the car on 24th Dec. 12 and paid 100% amount on 27th December, 2012 and requested to get us the Car RC dated January, 2013. (Cheque debited to our account on 29th December) Since that time we are informed that car will be delivered to us with in 4-5 days (i.e. latest by 5th or 6th January as 1st may be a holiday. However after 2nd January onwards some excuses are being given and car is yet to be delivered. We understand that the process of RTO had not been started on 2nd and that has resulted in whole delay. Some of the forms had not been obtained till 2nd and we were made to rush the same on 2nd Jan. We had requested at the begining that we shall get the car latest by SUNDAY or in any caseby Monday that is 7th January, 2013. It appears that either the RTO work is being given to an outsider and he has delayed the process or it is the negligence of the person handling the matter. Now to our surprise we are being informed that Car number is yet to be received and is likely to be received only after 6pm on 8th January. So car can not be delivered even on Tuesday 8th January. We asked to conatct us to the branch head but no care is being taken. We request you to intervene and resolve the issue today itself. Car booking made in the name of my wife Sujata Bhudeka Regards/Sampat Bhudeka 09819XXXXXX/ Sujata -9821XXXXXX.

Full Review 
Exterior Very nicely crafted. the redesigned tail lamps are very nice. the crome strip that enters the tail lamps is excellent. the front end is also very pleasing. The side view of the car is very excellent. it gives the feeling of a rich car like the merc c class. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) There is no exemption for space. it comes with a keyless start stop system. the seats though come wrapped in leather. there is lots of space at the front and acres of legroom at the rear. auto matic climate control, ABS, ESP, EBD across the range and and also gets equipped with twin air bags.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The K9K 1.5 lt diesel engine is a solid work horse. its got a wide spread of power.it builds pace gradually. in the mid range it feels really powerful. it gives you good responsiveness. its great for city usage. but in ghat sections you need to work a bit more but its not at all a problem. it is a free revving engine. the gearbox can feel a bit notchy when shifting quickly.
Ride Quality & Handling Unlike the sunny, the 15" rims are only available on the top end variant, the scala offers the bigger wheels on the mid and top end variants. the scala's ride quality is pretty good. at low speeds it feels more pliant. but as the speeds build the ride quality still feels quite composed, soaks up bumps quite well. the scala will offer a calmer back seat experience. hte additional weight of the diesel engine and the bigger wheels give the scala a bigger air. the steering is very direct. it is very light at low speeds and weighs up nicely as speeds build. you can chuck this car around corners which you cannot do in case of sunny. because this car has a slightly stiffer suspension.
Final Words So the renault scala is a perfect family car. go for it and you wont go wrong.
Areas of improvement The rear air circulation vents can be replaced with ac vents. for a change from sunny. so that the rear passengers can feel still better comfort. but its very nice.

A wonderful buying experience at the dealership. A wonderful car.
Very responsive dealer and customer friendly.
KHIVRAJ & RENAULT you rock.
They made my buying experience the best ever. excellent service, very responsive. A trusted name of Khivraj and A world class name of Renault and deadly combination. Experience like this, build the faith of taking decision on the right track. 
I travel around 80 kms a day avg. And i still feel fresh. Just a but noisy inside, rest all nice.
I had done a detailed study on other brands and dealers before investing my monies on this car. Trust me, Lanson Toyota, Kun Hyundai and Khivraj Renault have been the best experience ever, but what really did it in was also a car like scala, which other missed out having. 
Had the worst experience with Nissan dealers, and all Honda and VW dealers. Will definitely be recommending Scala and Khivraj to buy this car and enjoy a world class service and experience from the dealer. Thank you Renault and Khivraj for a delightful experience .

Full Review 
Exterior Give a feel of large car but more sharpness is required.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space is good and seating is comfortable however rear seat is slippery when brake is applied.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel economy is good but shifting of gear is not smooth. Some times cabin is noisy.
Ride Quality & Handling Not good not bad, looking to the nsize of car rear side needs improvment.
Final Words Give a feeling that you are driving a premium car but needs more luxury features.
Areas of improvement No cool Glove box, Not bottle Holders in back seats. Central Arm rest should be improved and more space should be created like INDIGO CLASSIC XL. Independent AC vent in rear side should be provided. Coat hangers and goggle box is also needed.  Service provied by dealers is not satisfactory. Staff of dealers needs more training to handle customers. more authorised service centres like maruti have must be opened.

Exterior
 Good looking front , avg. back portion. Plates are a little thin compared to vw or skoda. Well designed wheel alloys. paint quality is avg. Better to do some teflon coating or somthing. Head lamp design is world class, but may require a little powerfull bulb. Chromium touch all over the exterior parts looks good. Stock tyres are just ok
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Lot of good space . good comfort for even my grandma. Dash board is avg quality . player is good. But i changed my player to jvc 70bt fits perfect in the dash. Nice safety items including 2 airbags, abs..etc. steering mounted control is a basic thing. A little rattling inside my door panel , may be beacause of my custom made high power speaker . Rear vent fan is a good thing. A very good young famly car. i travel 230 km at a strech every week end back home. we never felt any discomfort. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Proven Engine. Engine power performance  is a kind of mixed deal with fuel efficiency. Good pickup and high way performance. i've clocked around 25000 km in my car, the best FE i got is 26 km/ L in smooth highway @85-90 km/hr , worst is 14 km/l in city heavy trafic. Gear box is also a good thing to use. BUt sudden overtaking need a plan with gears. But i dont care, since its giving me something in return ( FE)
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is good. Suspension is one of the best. Steering is good and accurate. not over corrected. Ground clearance is better than most of the cars in its class, but still makes mark at the bottom. Turning in city traffic is not horrible. Due to the length , need more planning than a hatchback during turning ,thats all.
Final Words
 Good looking matured Family car . adequate power and great comfort for passengers also with very good fuel economy
Areas of improvement  
 Rear and side design curves. Interior plastic quality. Bluetooth and usb connectivity in all models.

Exterior It is an elegant car. Its front view gives you the sporty feeling and rear view gives you the premium class feel. Its beautiful and attracts everybody. Everyone will ask you its details once you purchase it. I simply love its style.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very Comfortable seats, its too much spacious  (uncomparable legroom in front and rear), beautiful from inside as well and it is a feature packed car. Its interiors are similar to sunny but its seats are more comfortable and you feel rich while sitting inside.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I am getting mileage of around 19KMPL in city conditions and I dont think you can ask for a better mileage from 1.5 L engine.
Ride Quality & Handling Great in handling i.e. very easy to drive, it absorbs all the shocks on the road.
Final Words Its an awesome car and I totally recommend it for any one intending to buy a feature packed stylish and elegant sedan.

You will find most of the positive views on website cardekho.com about renault because cardekho.com has a tie up with renault india for providing customer services. you call or write to customer care of renault,it is handled by cardekho team. Well frankly speaking, forget about the car .renault dealers have hired the worst people to handle customers. In haryana most of the cities are aquired by one man and have the monopoly. I was literally abused by the salesman and the sales head backed him. This is pre sales position in Renault. I called the renault customer care which was handled by car dekhoo team but they said  that they have escalted the issue but no body called me up. Worst company which do not have a customer care of its own. Renault does not have their own manufacturing plant and neither customer care. Both Nissan and renault have huge shortage of their parts as all manufactured in same plant. My cousin have a nissan sunny and it took 30 days to change defective compressor. Throwing 10 lakhs to a company which can not even have a customer care is not advisable. Renault india website does not have any phone numbers of their offices. In no way, you can contact renault people. Toll free number is there which doesnot connect from mobiles and it connect to car dekho team.

This thing is sumthing new from the Renault stable. The Renault K9K engine gives some feeling... With a maximum output of 86PS @ 3750 RPM and a whooping  max torque of 200 NM @2000 RPM. It is around 1470 CC and is certainly worth it.
The electrcic power steering feels steady and shall make cars ride in the traffic easier and certainly better on highways. The rear is sumthing that impressed me the most. The chrome lining on the trunk with the name SCALA embrossed is just fabulous.
The smoked styled headlamps add to the design character of the car, giving it a modernand energetic feel. The wide chrome radiator grille that comes with a big bold Renault Logo, makes the Renault Scala look sophisticated and premium with something very new to the company's stable through the years. As a whole this a package which in worth the price and shaal prove to be a tough competition in this segment.

Exterior Exterior of the car are very stylish and appealing, and certainally among the best in the competiton. In fact in comparison to its sibling i.e. Sunny, Sacala's looks are more premium. Front headlemps and contast colored bumpers provides a great look.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Due to huge space , comfort is best in class, in fact it gives tough competition even to D1 segment. Audio system is the only disappointment as no USB connectivity, although speaker sound is very good. Plastic quality is good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Apart from Sapce, Engiene is the other big quality of this car. Very good performance, very good pic up. Good average too, getting average of 21.5 what more can one ask for.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good, very good car to drive in city conditions, altough steering feels stiff at the time of taking sharp cuts/turn.  
Final Words Overall best package in Sedan segment as one get car with all features, very good engeine providing good fuel economy.

After going through the big list of sedans I finally narrowed down to Renault's new Scala since I always wanted to buy a Nissan Sunny, I already had a Figo so tool my own time and the wait paid off. Scala is obviously a better choice than Sunny if you dont mind those extra bucks that you pay for. Now coming back to the story of the sales experience with dump ducks like Khivraj, I went to the Anna Nagar dealership to enquire on sales details I was told that Insurance is free along with GPS and parking sensors. I went there in about a week holding a cheque to pay the advance - now they tell me that its only the insurance that is free and didnt even bother to apoligize for miscommunication, I stepped out and escalated it to Renault customer care and within a week they came to my door step to take the booking but again I have to live with just the Insurance free offer. I have to push for delivery on my sons BDay and they also agreed that I can take delivery directly from the RTO office, I went there and guess what - I was able to find 11 faults with the brand new vehicle, even basic things like Stepnee, mud flaps was missing along with minor scratches on the body. I spent my diwali and again went on escalation - again people came to my door step and picked up the vehicle for rectification. They delivered a dirtly vehicle back this afternoon because of which I writing this down. If you are in chennai please be aware that the dealership has no access to the vehicle after sales so how much ever you yell at them there is no use - so when you take delivery ensure you do a through check before you leave. I wanted to share the pain I am going through to everyone so that instead of breaking our heads with a bunch of jokers its better we play it safe before hand so never ever take delivery out the door even if a small amount of disattisfaction. Otherwise I love the Scala and its a pleasure to own it.

I have arrange vehcile loan & balace cash payment in one day but unfortunately dealer was failed to give delivery on time ie at 3 pm. He was giving excuse about diwali holiday etc but at the same time just one day before he was assured me that he  will deliver the car by 3 pm. Atthe same to senior manager was not availabe to understand my problem. He was just sitting inside the cabin with no reason? After delivery also the service center techniciain was not aware about how to fit foot strip in the car  , he tried his best but lastly not suceed. Reverse sensor fitting tool was not available in the service center.  So ther is a SCOPE of IMPROVEMENT in this area.

Full Review 
Exterior Its really good looking; but some people have commented its the copy of sunny but its better than it its eye catching ;its  as simple as like this. You all gals are same but we choose the gal who is beautiful I dont mind spending extra 60 k than sunny bcoz its far better than it there is no compromissing we r ready to pay 11lakh I hope 60k would not be more for the looks we spend. Features are good space and comfort is awsome 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Performance is good not bad as expected fuel economy is really good in the city I have not gone for highway i will be going very shortly I will let u know the reviews when I come back as of now i am really happy most the people have told me that scala is better than sunny in looks so now i have felt that spended extra 60k did not waste thats were i was stasisfied with ood in city.

Exterior
 Most of the them get confused in side angle between toyota camry and Scala. Wonderful design by renault.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Space i call it mini foot ball ground. Comfort is good
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine Pick up is good. So far i have driven 2000 kms and I have got excellent mileage. Believe me or not I could achieve 27 kmpl with full A/C on and all five people packed + boot was almost fully packed on NH4 highway from bangalore <--> chitradurga (452 kms driven by just filling diesel for 1000 rs (16.7 liters). I just drove the car with speed maintaing between 90-105 kmp hr. 
 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Good absorbs most of the speed breakers , bumbs etc. but I feel steering wheel responding quickly to few road bumbs or rubber road humps which should be handled properly so that driver will not get disturbed.
Final Words
 
Areas of improvement  
- Music system of the car should be upgraded as per the latest cars (atleast GPS, bluetooth , USB support).
- Cup holders on the rear doors IS A MUST apart from the arm rest renault offers.

Exterior Looks great. Lenght of the car gives a very classy look. Looks best in Black or blue color.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are ok. Chrome door handles gives a luxury feel. If they could add 2 more inches to the width of the car, it would confortably fit in 3 full size grown adults. Leg space is something to die for. Very very confortable on long drives.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine packs a punch. Used to drive a Ford IKON(josh Machine) earlier. Diesel engine is a little noisy though quite refined. Cabin noise is also low. economy is phew 20-21kmpl on highway with 5 adults and AC, and speeds of around 110-120. City driving returns around 19 to 19.7kmpl(asper car reading) with speeds under 85km.
Ride Quality & Handling I am quite satisfied and impressed.
Final Words This is a car to keep for long time. My experience has been great with Renault. Keep open mind and think beyond reselling value :) and it will suprise you.
Areas of improvement Couple of inches wider :)

Exterior Beautiful chrome finished handles and front grill. Sensational colour make it different
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Quite comfortable, Music system is not as per its price, Hence I have purchased CASKA music system to maintain its class.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is little noisy, pickup is also low compare to other sedans. Gear is smoth.
Ride Quality & Handling Provide lots of pleasure during driving. ABS is good performer.
Final Words Provides a feeling of own a car with little difference.
Areas of improvement Needs improvement in terms of pickup. Sometimes gets sudden speed during turing.  The company (Renault) should monitor its dealer's behaviour to the customers. The Dealer of Bhilai (Mahdev Motors) has no monitoring to its sales representatives. The dealer does not provide theaccessories as per commitement. Due to this I had to face a very bitter experience during delivery of car.

Full Review 
Exterior
 I'd rate it as the best in class in looks & style - that's why I bought it in the first place!
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 A bluetooth system would do well. But Scotsche solves that. Huge leg rooms for all passengers. Very comfortable below 20 kmph & above 60 kmph on pits & speedbreakers. Overall, really smooth and very low cabin noise
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Around 2000 rpm the car really gets smoothness & power together. It becomes a pleasure to drive. Fuel economy has been like 16-17 ish. Gearbox is fine.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is amazing. So is handling. The latest electronic features, are not even there in Audi Q5. I drove it at 170 kmph on Agra expressway in the night and it was a smooth drive, overtook every car I approached.
Final Words
 I bought this car on 10 May 2013, and am truly happy that I did. I just want to drive it every day! Driven ~15,000 km till now.
Areas of improvement  
 Plastic quality and quality of material in bumper, given that there're too many cars hitting you from behind, due to reckless attitude of drivers in India. 
But the car is a must buy in its range. Much more leg room and passenger-cum-driver comfort as compared to a Vento, City or Rapid, or even Duster.

Exterior Excellent styling on front, Rear is just OK.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Pros: Really good features compared to Base model (RxE). Excellent space, 3 can sit very very comfortably in rear seat. Hand rest is good. Driving seat is comfortable.
Cons: Music System- After test drive i was very dissupointed with Music system. No USB & bluetooth, it is offered in most of same & low end competiors cars. Controls on Steering looks very ugly. Reanult tried to match shape with AC controls but I feel it is Ugly. Definetly not of Renault range. Dash board- Passinger side dash board has huge curvy area which is of no use. Display- Digital display screen should have been bigger. Rear seats- Does fan vents make any difference?. Front side suction area may suck small papers or any small items.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Great Engine for sure. Very good fuel economy for 85PS. Gear shift is not very comfortable, But Gear shift buffer will cover it. You will have enough time to shift gears in traffic due to this.
Ride Quality & Handling Suspension is superb. Steering is little hard. Overall very good. 
Final Words Excellent choice if you are not very perticular about Dashboard & control buttons.
Areas of improvement Definetly Dashboard and Music system.

Full Review 
Exterior:  Sporty Look. Luxury Look, Primum Look, Fresh Look, look of "HUGE CAR"
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort). We tried sitting on back seat when we took test ride of all the sedans and large hatch backs as well as SUVs. We found maximum space and comfort in scala when compared to 1.Verna 2.Vento 3.Fiesta 4.Ertiga 5.Amaze 6.Dzire 7.Manza
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox. Pick up is ZABAR ZAST in all gears. If you try to over take a Sedan like Dzire or SUV like E  on highway in 5 th Gear, it takes the challange swiftly. Inside City pick up is better than most sedans (gear 2/3).
 
Ride Quality & Handling: I was fanatic about DUSTER for a year. Took test drive three times, but Scala scored better in ride quality. Every thing is smooth paddles, stearing, doors, wipers etc. Every one sitting inside are Comfortable. Rear Seats has awsome leg space with central arm rest, where u can immidiately streach your self on occupying the seat.
 
Final Words
If you want to buy DEISEL SEDAN.. Choice is SCALA ( It GIVES YOU ALL FOUR : ECONOMY STYLE PERFORMANCE COMFORT )
 Rajkot Gujart DEALERS  and Service Personal are GOOD.
Areas of improvement They must add more features like 6th gear, Navigation, USB, Blutooth, Cruise control.

Full Review 
Exterior Great looks, road presence.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Plastics used are below expectation, music system complete put-off.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Thumbs-up on fuel economy, gear box mating is not that great -- one has to get used to using the stick and clutch as the revv's tend to keep the car speeding further on low-gears.
Ride Quality & Handling I doubt if the engineers have considered Indian roads for suspension. My brakes tend to make loud noise -- silly reason sighted by dealer was because of carbon from alloy wheels and ABS (planning to replace them while in warranty)
Final Words I favoured scala for safety (ABS & 2 airbags) considering it a must, while my father liked the massiv boot space and cabin space -- After spending all that money, you also need to feel good while on the inside, and the entertainment and plastics clearly disappoint. I doubt the re-sale of Renault cars in near future.
Areas of improvement Interiors, infotainment, suspension.

Full Review 
I own a Renault Scala(KL 59 XXXXX) which I bought from Renault Kannur showroom 11 months back. Four months after I bought the car I noticed that the ac was not working properly(sometimes hot air was coming out of the ac vent).So I approached the Renault service centre at Kannur and after taking three days for inspection we were told that the damage caused to the outer air vent of the ac by rat entry was the reason for the ac malfunction and that it was not covered under the warranty. The service manager advised us to change the blower at an expense of Rs 25000 since according to them it was the only solution. Since I was not convinced we decided to opt out of their advise. But on the evening after this service I noticed foul smell coming out of the ac and gave the car for a second service at the same service centre. Taking three more days and after paying Rs 3000 they gave the car back but foul smell still persisted and the problem with ac remained the same. I contacted the customer care centre but the only reply we received was to follow the advice of service centre personnel. Finally I had the car rechecked by an ac mechanic and by an hour he was able to find out that the problem was that shutter of the heater was jammed in the open position and he was able to correct it in no time with Rs 300 as the service charge. Such a simple problem could not be detected by the service personnel even after two services taking six days. I am very much disappointed with the after sale service provided by Renault and I will never recommend this brand to anyone eventhough in other aspects the car functions satisfactorily.

Exterior Good, I love it from side angle.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space is huge. My first reason to buy this car. Under Thy support isn't very good. Tons of boot space.
Engine Performance is good, no major surprises as of now after 1 year. Fuel economy is good. Getting 19 km with AC on City Road. Got 24 km on highway. Pick up is good. Head room for back seat is Ok. If you have 6 feet + passesngers, then they gonna compliant. Audio system is ok types. 
Ride Quality & Handling Ride is good but not very stable at high speed. Car Flys on bumps. Service cost is reasonable. I paid approx. 6000 each for 2 service in first year.
Final Words Good car to buy for city drive. Not very sporty and good to drive on high speed (> 100 km/hr) on high ways.
Areas of improvement USB Support, Make it more heavy for better grip on roads.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox

Ride Quality & Handling
Smooth car. But safety features are totally bad. I had a bad car accident when I tried to avoid an animal on the highway by steering slightly to the left and trying to apply brakes. Car skidded to the right, rear end came to front direction, car moved to the side of the road and over turned in the small ditch at the side of the road. It was a narrow escape for me and my friends. Everybody were saved just because even the back seat riders were wearing seat belts. The road was flat, no pot holes, no oil, no rain - with all these perfect conditions also my car skidded.
When compared to hatchback cars, you can feel the drag at the back when you want to turn in hilly roads and i guess the weight distribution of the car is not correct, which caused the skid in my case. I had driven other cars where i was able to steer clear of these kinds of obstacles and ride safely, even on snowy surfaces at US.
Another point, Airbags did not deploy even after rollever. Company says it will deploy only on frontal impacts. However, in my case the car had impacts to sides of front of the car, the gaurd ripped off - still no airbag deployed!!!
If you are thinking of going for this car thinking it looks good and has safety features like ABS with EBD, and at highway speeds you can avoid something, it will be a wrong assumption. 
Final Words
For safety reasons do not go for this car. or if you want to drive at a very low speed of under 60 on highways, you may go for this car.

Final Words It is very Good buy considering the cost paid & the comfort you get from the car...
Areas of improvement The body thickness can be increassed & can use better tyre makes rather than JK tyres which gives bit of noice, Seats can be much more comfortable, The front & rear of the cars doesn't looks like a big sedan.

Exterior The exterior is great and looks similar to High End cars.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Renault should have provided the high end features like rear wiper, Bigger Glove space, Body side moulding, Rear Camera. The seat height adjustment is not too useful as the height increase is limited. Other common features which may not have added to cost like coat hanger, and glove space on driver side could have made car great. The side door pocket space is not to useful as the space is small.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance & fuel economy seems to be ok. Gear box is ok.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality and handling is OK.
Final Words Good car. Renault should advertize the car as market is not aware of the name Scala. With no advertizement , I wonder if Renault is serious on the car.

Exterior The new Ford Fiesta 2014 with the Austin Martin front grill has the looks of a show stopper. It does turn quite a few heads on the roads. I've test driven every car in this in this segment i.e. Rapid, Vento, Linea, Sunny, Scala and the Honda City diesel. This is my analysis, loved the way 2nd gear torque on the Vento/ Rapid (essentially the same engine), loved the rear seating of the sunny (only and only that), lived the dashboard trim of the Linea (and also the interior ambient lighting). Then I test drove the Fiesta. It id quite up there with the engine performance of the Rapid (well just about), it has the dash is aesthetics of the Linea and technology (SYNC and other minor attention to detail features) that is unmatched in it class. The voice command operation of your phone is unparalleled. I think a special mention about the music system is befitting. It has incredibly crisp and audibly loud (no noise) sound. The rear seating is a bit cramped compared to other in it class. 
Ride Quality is brilliant. The suspension is very sturdy where it needs to be. On the highways, it snugs to the road.

Exterior
 Good styling. Looks great from the side view, not so good looking from the front.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Front seats are very comfortable and lot of spaces for storing knick nacks, water bottle, mobile etc. However, if you have a driver and prefer to sit in the back seat, this is not the car for you. Back seats are very cramped and one does not feel comfortable. The centre arm rest is higher and not comfortable to rest your hand. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Excellent engine performance and you can hardly feel any lag at slow speeds. Gear shift is very smooth and very smooth. In heavy city traffic, I am getting an average of 15kmpl. ABS works fine, airconditioning very good.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Excellent ride quality and easy to handle. 
Final Words
 Excellent for self driving. Not recommended for driver driven and rear seat travel. Excellent music system with blue tooth connectivity and voice commands
Areas of improvement  
 The back seating has to definetely improve along with hand rest re-alignment. One expects the hand rest to be very comfortable.

Exterior The New looks for the car are fabulous, especially the aston martin look alike grill. Good head lights and tail lights too.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good interiors like to screen and the new sync system. slightly slow in reading but it is up there. The interior plastic is comparitivley better than previous version. Need more work on internal plastic work, as after  some days there are sounds of vibration. Love the volume increase and decrease as per the change in speed and noise around.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is awesome, very responsive and matches the weight of the vehicle, the engine is very quiet and responses well. Four months since perchase vehicle is providing avg of 19 in city like mumbai. I think reducing the tyre size (width) will yeild more mileage i guess. Smooth gear transmittion and good response from engine.
Ride Quality & Handling All ford vehicles have awesome ride quality and handling. The vehicle is responsive and handles well on the curves.
Final Words Buy, if you love driving. 
Areas of improvement BACK SEAT needs great deal of improvements. may be push the back seat further into the boot to provide leg space. PLEASE WORK HARD ON BACK SEAT, awesome features for that price.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Nice driver and passenger seat,  rear seat cramped by its ok for 2 person. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 1.5D gives great power and performance,  I am regularly getting around 14-16 KM in city,  and upto 22 KM in highways,  if speed controlled by up 90 KM,  which is very easy in this car due to Cruise Control.
Gearbox is perfect,  No issue.
Ride Quality & Handling
It have excellent Ride and Handling.  I got chance to drive few expensive cars,  but I can say Fiesta have great Handling compare to expensive cars. 
Final Words
 If you are looking drivers car,  go for it.
Areas of improvement  
 If ford can offer open service like maruti,  I bet no one buy Maruti.

Ride Quality & Handling is superb as i said before if cross 120 speed on highways or indian roads no vibrations, grip on the road is ery nice. i am using for last 3 years but still gives me a satisfaction of driving and travelling comfortably.
Only the concern area is ground clearance is very low so thatyou always have to be careful about oil sump which is down at driver seat and its difficult to drive through big speed breakers.
Final Words If you wanna enjoy your vehicle's comfort and performance go for Fiesta it has all your solutions in one car.
Areas of improvement Ground clearance and suspensions.

Exterior
 exterior look very nice even though a bit classic in front.the beauty of the car is from sideways. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 spacious interiors.good for 3 adults and one children in back seat.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 1.3 engine is enough for our roads this is not less power since we r very populated country and lot of vechiles on road we can go more then 100kms always.they seem to have tuned the engine in shvs so no lag of power.second gear turbo helps to over take in city conditons ( within seconds it touchs 70kms).80 to 100 is best to enjoy very easily the car touches 140kms..fuel economy depends on the road and place and where u drivecity conditions it may give 16.5 with ac ( before first service) and in long outer drives it gives around 21 ( before first service).its hard to find when shvs work.
Ride Quality & Handling
 very very easy to drive ( if any females want to drive a big sedan  this is the best car).
Final Words
 unlike lot of hatchbacks designs available in india carmarket.there are only 5 sedan model namely city,ciaz , verna , skoda and vento.Among these only city and ciaz sell the most each selling 7000 and 5000 all others dont even sell 1500 cars.for about 10lakhs ciaz is the best car to buy with two airbags,abs and ebd.
Areas of improvement  
car interiors should look  modern..have to upgrade switch designs.car mostly look like a assembled one urgently. should sell in nexa show room only bcz dealers treat ciaz customers like alto or omni customers.

Exterior Simply superb. I mean I really liked the styling and i got some MGA door beading and stuff which makes it look sooper cool.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Was amazed by the interior comfort. I upgraded from Dzire and felt a HUGE difference. Be it the NVH levels or just the sheer comfort. AAbsolutely loving it.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Am not a power hungry person and hence not felt the "underpower" that is commonly said. But can agree to the fact that when compared to Verna it is under. On the hind side that has got its own advantages as well. SHVS works like a charm. Loving it everytime it quietly turns the engine off.
Ride Quality & Handling AWESOMEEEEE>..... is the only word.!!!!
Final Words Go for it. Just go for the ZDI  version as the touch seems to buggy for that extra 1L. Absolutely loving the experience of driving it. The interior comfort is soo good that you dont feel like stopping. Just fantastic. The AC is really good. I had upgraded from Dzire and feeling like there is totally a class difference from what i had earlier.
Areas of improvement So far nothing.

Exterior
 Stunning look and very strong build quality, premium look, the 16’’ alloy wheels are an add on advantage and of course the 185 ground clearance. You can take this beauty to any good or worst roads without any strain.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Nicely designed interiors lot of leg space and accommodate 5 adults easily even for a long drives (but, lil congested rear seats for tall people). Lot of features enriched in this new 2014 Linea emotion pack version. This is the only vehicle in the segment has 500 litters boot space and that is very essential too. The total length of the vehicle is 4596 (4.6) and the only vehicle in this segment has this huge. You will defiantly feel that you are in a premium car (diesel version is lil heavy).
 Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine performance is good. However, It lags a bit below 1500 rpm hence for city drive we might feel lil gloomy (once you are used-to it there will be no issues). But for highway drive definitely this is the king and there is no doubt about that. For this weight and size at least 1.6 liter diesel engine is a really must one. So this might be a negative. But can be manageable. But, if, FIAT should have done this, none of the same segment cars will come near to this Italian beauty.
Fuel efficiency is also pretty good I am getting 16 overall with 90% ac on. I crossed 9000kms so far.
Gear box is really smooth compare to other diesel vehicles.
When it comes to safety and security, this has ABS, EBD, adjustable steering, auto rain sensing wipers, auto head lamps, follow me head lights, Dual Airbags, Early crash sensors, fire prevention system, very good breaking system, etc… This beauty has inbuilt engine immobilizer with rolling code.
Ride Quality & Handling
 New 2014 Linea is very robust, smooth and handling is very nice. Cruise control is another advantage and it really very helpful for long journeys.
Final Words
This is a very good vehicle for family especially those who prefer long highway journey also good for city drives.
I like my 1.3 mulitijet diesel emotion 2014 Linea very much and it is worth buying. Your hard earned money you spent is really worth.
Few observations
1.     Engine CC should be upgraded to 1.6
2.     Frond arm rest is not so convenient so fiat should rethink.
3.     Less utility space inside the cabin
 
 4.     Road visibility is bit stringent

Exterior
 Excellant style
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Very good fittings though my version has indicator handle on left side, probably because designed for right hand drive, rear seat tall people will touch roof.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Good engines, no problems, no breakdowns, still on original battery and tyre, though gear feels a little stiff. On accerlation turbo kicks in smoothly and no stress overtaking.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride is excellant on good roads and highways, no noise at 100 also, it is so smooth that dont relise when overspeeding. Bumpy roads ride is stiff. Handling is good ahs power steering
Final Words
 An very good buy except for a little low clearance for Indian roads
Areas of improvement  
 This car should have a auto gear. and the rear roof has to be raised by another 5 cm.
The newer versions are already coming with higher clearances, so that problem is solved though they should have offered existing owners discount on the suspension work to raise the clearance

New Linea FL Emotion Diesl model.
I bought New Fiat Linea early this year..till date i drove 3000k which includes hilly and long drives of 1500 KM. the ride experience was amazing...what a comfort, stability , balance, grip..truly outstanding.. in hilly section ABD EBD works fantastically..also the staring does not required to operate much on even steady and sharp curves.. leg space , seat adjustment and back support is very good..overall its perfect product even for City ride ..length doesn't mater at all..only need extra space for parking...rest is fine..engine requires at least 1000KM to set and then it gets better and better day by day..highly recommenced to people who are keen to know safety, comfort and engine performance..Suggestion to buy Emotion pack whicg comes with 16 inch 205 mm alloy wheels for solid comfort on ride with company fitted leather covers. and many more features.
Check the ride qaulity for long test drive when buying..so that you know the diffrence between others and Fiat.

Full Review 
Exterior The New Linea Looks good especially after the rear has been changed with the new number plate being push to the Boot Lid.The chrome and liberally used chrome does add a good feel to the car. Still feel the handles should be full chrome. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Looks great Inside with the new Soft Touch Dash and Nicely Finished Dash Board.Music System Design looks but yes gives a mix of classic and modern looks.The back seat is very comfortable and this car is among the forty cars I drove before buying which has both driver's and rear seat passengers equal comfort.
As I said you do get a premium Feel.Look at the roof when you get inside and from the fabric used you will be able to judge difference between this car and the other cars in terms of premium feel.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Yes it does have a Turbo Lag at lower Gears and feels sluggish in initial pick up.but post that its a fun to drive vehicle. Have minimal noise inside the cabin and does give a very smooth ride.The fuel economy clocked on Mumbai-Pune Expressway was 21km/l and City average is 14km/l at an average speed of 22km. The gera is rubbery but is smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling The best drive for Fiat is on the open roads and it is a very comfortable car to drive. I havent had the luxury of sitting at the back but on the feedback has been good for pillion riders.A small point to add is that Linea is an easier car to get in and get out of it and it is an important features especially for the elders.  
Final Words I would say if people are out there to decide to buy a goof product and dont go out to buy just the brands,Fiat will offer them a surprise as was evident with my collegues who bought other brands in this segment.
Areas of improvement Definately require more service centres.Still need to expereince their service levels.

Exterior I really liked it when I first saw it. The exterior styling and looks are still one of the best! 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Decent amount of space inside. May be a little uncomfortable for tall people.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I have now owned the car for 3.5 years (>70k km)  and enjoyed it. Being a diesel it is a little heavy but once in 4th gear it can be a beast. Mileage with AC in summers in about 12 kmpl and in winters about 14 kmpl. The car still drives as good as new. Have taken it to many outdoor trips.
Ride Quality & Handling You accept a little heaviness as it is a diesel car. However it is comfortable inside. AC is good and trouble free. Handling is good. Drives like a dream on highway particularly yamuna expressway.
Final Words Having owned both Honda City and Fiat Linea I have no hesitation recommending Linea for its styling, fuel economy and ruggedness.
Areas of improvement I guess the music system is now full featured. Interior can be more plush. Better ground clearance would be good.

Exterior
I bought this on 2nd May 2015.before I bought I have driven all 8-9 cars in this segment.but finally and very last I drive this one.Exterior wise very nice looking.nice straight lines.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Why people obsessed about honda city interior? Very good quality interior.finishing and material used is quite better than others
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Initially I got 15-16 km.for 1000 km.but now I always get overall 18-19 kms with averge speed of 75km.my fluctuation speed between 75-115.with cruise control on expressway I got 18km.It depends on how you drive..
initial leg at lower gears.one takes time to be familiar with it.fiat has to fix this issue.initial punch is necessary.bigger engine almost 1500cc.need for this heavy car.If fiat will do,no other car match linea.
Ride Quality & Handling
Superior in this segment.once feel it only after driving it.I make a choice to buy in just one test drive almost 8kms. (Thanks to fiat sales executive --sukrit Fiat; SURAT).After driving in both city and highways.best feedback of steering.you feel confident.steering little heavy but very early used -to it.
Final Words
I mostly drive on highways.so my review is according to that.but in our indian city conditions,comfortable to me .
Areas of improvement  
Improve service centre facilities. In gujarat few fully trained technicians.
I can't able to understand, ..fiat makes very nice vehicles but failed to improve marketing and service.
Lower gear to power ratio needs to  change.no complaints in 4-5th gear.
True speaking ..I don't have any bad experience till.but it's my opinion.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Nice and smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling Roayal & Pleasing.
Final Words Car is good but not the dealers.
Areas of improvement  FIAT Cars are really good but dealers should be more aggresive to bring out the product. Absoultely Sales Head is not at all bothered (Why should he? as long as he is paid like a govt job???) about the customers visiting the showroom, he didnt even leaves his chair and comes to the customer to explain about the car. We should look at the cars ourselves like orphans. This should change due these kind heartless people Fiat is loosing its market in India.
The attitude of the Sales Manager is very pathetic and not customer friendly, recently i booked a Fiat Linea. The sales manager till getting the advance from me he was calling the whole day. After that he never called me rather he rejected my calls. However I continued to go ahead and book the car ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SALES EXECUTIVE Mr. RAHUL due to his very friendly approach. I dont know who is managing the delearship Must meet them. Plz share the contact of the MD of Ramkay fiat.

Exterior Similar to Audi, fillet every where, it’s a smooth everywhere.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Even though not great, but nothing much to complaint, But there is no Aux-in option available. Every time, you need to copy the files into pen drive and play. This is the only big complaint I have.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox In last 4.6 years drover over 48,000 KM, on an averge I got about 20 KMPL (in all road & weather condition).
Ride Quality & Handling This is where I find Linea is superior than any other car. Great handling, tried max speed of 165 KMPH, but no problem. It just do what you say. Tried cornering even at 120 KMPH, heard tyre noise, but handling...cool....I got 2011 model with less ground clearance, but Fiat offered the option to increase the ground clearance. Haven't found any big difference. So far, only big change, changed all four tyres after 36,000 KM. Otherwise everything is fine, even the battery, brake. Haven't spend anything apart from Ground clerance kit and 4 tyres.
May people advised not to go for Fiat, but I took the chance. No regret at all. Infact, after I drove other car, I feel lot better that I didn't make any mistake by choosing any other car.

Full Review 
Exterior
 What a fantastic flowing design, a bit feminine, slow and elegant design, not a wide body hence can squeeze in traffic easily between 2 vehicles 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 long car, enough leg space for a 6.1 ft guy like me, quality of plastic is definitely good, contrast is good, no Aux in old models is bad, dashboard could be a bit more brighter and wider
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 for a heavy car of 1200 kgs 1.3 l engine is a bit low, but makes it up with 90 NM, fuel econom- i have got 18-19 km/l on pune expressway and in city 14 km/l, gear is smooth, joy stick can be re done
Ride Quality & Handling
 diesel engine needs to be driven on 1st gear to get it going, handling is smooth especially on traffic conditions, high turning radius is a set back- always need to reverse to get into mall parking which is winding and also on narrow intersections.
Final Words
 A car which can last comfortably for 1.5 lakh kms, classy, evergreen design, build quality and weight, at 50k kms and 3.5 yrs no part replaced.
Areas of improvement  
 Turning Radius is not good now, a bit more power for initial torque, low ground clearance (mine is 2012 model), Service centers must improve their customer interaction...! Balaji service sucks! Work is okay but other things are bad.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior also nice looking, behind the 2nd row seat and above boot area, material used is not good quality and not matching to the class.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent engine performance and fuel economy, gear shifting is not smooth like Honda city. 
Ride Quality & Handling Ride qulity quite rigid and stable in city and highways, but efforts on styring is quite high compare to Honday city and also on rough roads stying rotates as tyres gets input from road. 
Final Words Good Car in the segment, only if considered with disel as fuel. 
Areas of improvement Interior plastic quality, specially behind 2nd row seat and above boot area. Stay ring mechanism need to change to electronic. Let see how maintenance costs in the future. Fiat should work on service stations. Fiat should have agressive marketing strategy. Good vehilce considering safety aspect.

Exterior Very elegant a little conservative exterior but gives a feel of solid construction seating position is good and one feels secure while behind the steering.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Lot of space and rear seat legroom can drive comfortably in a driver driven car. the boot is large enough to take international baggage.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance in satisfactory if you are a little patience but the fuel economy is good and the gearbox is well matched .My driving was mostly in the city and it is a good city car.
Ride Quality & Handling Satisfactory to good.
Final Words Its perhaps the best car for its value.altghough the listed prices are comparable with the segnent but frequent discount offers make it a very good buy.The recent enrichment with features has made the car comparable with the best in its class.I have just sold my old about 3 year old car with 60000kms and have been searching the market for an alternative.I have once again decided on the new aLinea.
Areas of improvement Need to change the body design its now become common.

Full Review 
Exterior Stylish exterior with best in class ground clearance and length. Look wise definitely best looking sedan in country in this segment.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is stylish as well with Piano black dashboard with beige combination. Looks stunning with ambient lighting. Very conformable front seats with lot of leg room (I am 6”3). The rear space can be made better though.
Love the Blue and Me and seamless synching. Great Visibility with powerful headlamps. Suspension set is great as well. Overall looks quite luxurious inside the cabin. One segment up for sure.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The Power produced by 1.3 L diesel engine is just enough to drive anywhere. There is a turbo lag until you reach 1200 RPM though. But one needle passes 2000 RPM you get full boost of Tourqe and it takes off.
Good Fuel Economy. I got 19.6/L on log drive (800 KM). Gearbox not so smooth but very convenient. Overall drive is quite enjoyable and relaxed.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality of Linea is astonishing. The ABS works perfectly at high speed and hardly any problem at high speed on turns. I drove this Vehicle @140/KMPL on Bangalore-Pune highway, but Vehicle was rock Solid on road. I felt could have Goan even further easily. Noise insulation is ok too considering a Diesel car. It is too good for a car with has 185 MM of ground clearance and 16 inch Alloy Wheels.
Final Words Love this car. Not sure why you don't too many of them on Road. I am a happy customer so far .
Areas of improvement
1. Although 1.3 L Diesel Engine is enough, but considering the build quality of the car 1.6 L engine would be great for Drivers.
2. Auto foldable ORVM and provision of Sunroof will make this car even more feature rich.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine performance is too low at starting and overtaking. but above 2000rpm its enough... i dnt feel VGT works in car, it works smooth on highway. in hilly area the car is different with VGT it give more power with respect to our acceleration. but very very smooth engine. i drove many car but this is more smooth. fuel economy is good, gives 18-19kmpl in highway with auto AC mode. with full auto AC mode it gives 16.8kmpl. i drove 10000km

Every 5000 KM  I am facing clutch problem . Today  (18/9/2014), I have faced same cluth problem. With in 1000 KM following problem arised :
Clutch problem:
1) On 28th Dec 2013 replaced cluth at Pundut Auto Garage , Pune
2) Today 18th Sep 2014 , vehicle break down at Worli Mumbai, slowely i driven car upto Thane  
Battery Drained Out:
1) Replaced new battery Tata Green in month of June 2014 at Balaji Service Center.
Last 10 years  I am driving Maruti wagnor in Mumbai without any problem, I feel I have some driving  sense.
I wrote to  Fiat Service manager  but he did not reply. Fiat is least bothered about their customers. 
So I will suggest do not think about purchasing  of Fiat Product
Ride Quality & Handling Good.
Final Words Do not purchase fiat car
Areas of improvement Mechanical improvement and product should be suitable to Indian Condition.

This is a beautiful looking caaaaaar! Soo spacious infact 6th person can sleep on its second row floor and the 7th in its monster boot (490 lts) !!! There are more pros for this gorgeous looking Beast than its cons. This is C+ sedan looking for some serious competion from D segment sedans(Audi A4)! I have driven this vehicle for 25000 km and everytime I drive this car I feel proud of owning this vehicle...Very good brakes , nice input from steering makes it a champ in its class..As all cars do this vehicle has some cons too..Like the ground clearence..But do u think Indian roads are good for any foreign sedans? Infact Indian roads are buit for Trucks,bullock carts and cheap Tata vehicles (not much difference between Road speed brakers and mountains in south india though). Sunny is purely built for good express highways..If u are frequent traveller in village roads then Nissan Torrano is the good choice..Sunny is a no nonsense full paisa vasool vehicle...you definetly get more than you paid for plus peace of mind..Their dealership has improved phenomenally..the quality of the vehicle is extremly good..the cabin noice is a little bit high at higher RPMs (130 kms plus)..But then I never got a chance to drive anything more than 130 kms (well again you know Indian Trucks on highways driving all around you taking their frustrations)..This vehicle promised to give me 21 and its giving 20.06 km highways at 100 kms and city 17..(many times I forget to fill its diesel tank)..Plus not so costly dealership and service costs makes me love this vehicle.To conclude: If you are looking for a spacious comfortable( highway) Luxurious Sedan and which can suit your budjet( compared to Skoda or Volkswagon) with loads of boot space (infact you can sleep inside) this vehicle is for you. If you frequently drive more in city then CVT petrol Sunny is the best choice. Buy this vehicle for Large Boot space, Acres of interior space, Reliable Efficient Engine , Comfort..improved dealership experience and if you are a frequent express highway traveller. Do not buy this vehicle if you are sports enthusiast and want to experiment this car on rough terrain .

Exterior
 good looks. beautiful body lines and looks big like caar. one important point is the bottom touches the humps easily with 3 to 4 people on board.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 excellent features and best in class space. you name any feature its there in this car. AC is excellent and steering mounted music system controls help a lot. interiors are excellent in this car. back seat space is excellent and accommodate a bench also and is not matched by any other car in this segment.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 engine performance of diesel model is excellent, good fuel economy, but gearbox gets struk at first and second gears is a concern.
Ride Quality & Handling
 very good ride and handling. very comfortable to drive in city traffic and hasslefree.
Final Words
 very good car with very bad breaks, which spoils entire car reputation.
Areas of improvement  
 breaking must improve. Ground clearance must improve. 
 tyre size should increase for the size of this car.

Exterior Excellent design.  Its aeodynamic design helps you to manuover very easily.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very awesome, especially rear. Solid space.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Perofrmance is extremely good especially in highways. Fuel economy inside the city  may not be very Attractive.
Ride Quality & Handling No complaints.
Final Words "VALUE FOR MONEY". Gear box is very smooth. Tyres give a good feel of road grip. power stearing  glides you through the city traffic. You can drive the car in 3rd gear while you are 25 kms/hour. My experience in highway is extremely good. Smooth drive and excellent pick up.
Areas of improvement I bought sunnvy XV petrol variant with push start. Good feel of the car. Fuel economy especially within the city is really worrisome. You may not get more than 9 Kim's/litre. Need good console. Nissan hasn't provided One. These days talking on the phone iwhile driving has become a necessary evil.

Exterior Looks good from side and front from back its less attractive.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) All average featurs . space is good for rear and for front. Good boot space.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good engine with good pickup and gives good fuel economy i m getting 15.5 kmpl with manual ac with autoclimate control you can get more. notchy gearbox.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good and handling is also it feels like playing videogame I mean there is no feedback , very smooth handling.
Final Words Car is good and tested one but the main problem is with dealer and their employees, after booking there is ess communication, and they are not proving exact/detailed information what we are getting (accesories and addons). i got my car through ritu nissan bhandup and i m very disapointed with their service and customer handling. i wasted my thousands due to their wrong information on accesories.
Areas of improvement Nissan indian should carefully choose their dealres and must train their staff for being loyal with customer.

Interior - Car is roomy, perticularly rear seat leg space is fantastic
 
Engine Performance also very good but gear shifting is required to be improve with respect to smoothness
 
Ride Quality & Handling - I enjoy the car ride very much, only thing is that within 6 months my car AC is not functioning properly. Such a nice car with high price should not have such under perforformed AC.
 
Final Words - I purchased the petrol version car (Sunny XV) 2015 Feb. 
Comfort level is very good although fuel consumption is quite high compare to current similar segment car. I am getting max 15km/l in the high road. AC is very bad as the rear seat passenger not get the effect even though blower is present.
Moreover, within 6 months my car AC is not functioning properly (not getting cool).
I could not got the scope to visit the workshop, as it is 150 km away from my place, but definitely I am looking desperately to rectify it.
Beleive this is not the sign of a new sedan car who is competing with Honda City or Toyota Etios
 
Areas of improvement- Shifting gear, Fuel economy, AC, inside look and backlit buttons for easy finding in dark.

This is just a small engine (1.4L) on a big chassis. interiors are 3rd class. Suspension wears out extremely soon and the whole car starts to wobble.
Don't be foooled by its long length. That is all this car has. Service centers are non responsive and do not pay attention to your complaints.
Fuel economy indicator is a false one. measure it on your own and you will notice the difference.
I get only 8 kmpl. company claims 14 ! engine lacks power. even a small hatchback like brio has more acceleration than this piece of junk.
Whole car will start to wobble after 5000 kms. it vibrates at high speeds (105 kph).
This is the worst company I have seen. Car's AC vents also get chocked up every now and then.  my cars is barely 9000 kms and I already had to clean the vents. Moreover this was not covered for free. I had to pay 3.5k to get it done.
Wasted 10 lakhs for nothing. Do yourself a favour and get a Honda city or a Toyota Corolla.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The front seats are comfortable for even a 6" footers, thanks to the long travel  range, its easy to find a comfirtable seating with seat height * Steering rake/reach adjustment. Nice and cool Audio s  System, Plastics are of High quality.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smooth Gears you can enjoy the gear pattern & swift between gears,  Superb diesel engine:good drivability and 250Nm of Tourque, in city i am getting 14Kmpl and in Highways 20Kmpl.Even in long rides you wont feel tiered i usually go for long rides.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling is very good,Confidence inspiring dynamics, Breaks and chassis.The suspension is well configured to be stiff without becoming uncomfortable for the passengers. It is a good balance without being too hard or too soft. The car never lets any bumps transfer to the passengers.
Final Words Over all good need to improve the service centers in India and finally "I enjoy My Skoda Rapid".
Areas of improvement Improvement in after sales Service and availability of Accessories.

I wish to share the incident I face with my new car (HONDA CITY) which I brought up in February 2015   (Chassis no- MAKGM85AXXXXXXX, Engine No. N15A12XXXXX).
On 29th July 2015 while driving my car, Sun Roof glass exploded all of a sudden in the middle of road with gunshot noise. Thankfully because of a highway, there wasn't any other vehicle nearby. Else I might have met with a serious road accident. I was fortunate that the inner shutter was closed else it could have resulted in big accident. I thoroughly checked for any possibility of hitting of any objects but couldn’t find any such thing. I immediately took my car to local dealer in Sonipat (Haryana-India). who in turn sent the pictures for further evaluation to Honda. They also told me that there is no sign any object hit event.
I also called up Honda121customer care for the same with Communication ID number 1-3110288512.
Later I was informed by dealer that Honda refuse to accept any manufacture defect and the part replacement will not be done under Warranty, although its brand new car.
After many follow-ups with customer care in India there is no fruitful outcomes, with no way for me to go I apply for Insurance claim on April 4th, 2015 with a pain in my heart as this thing should have been taken care under warranty by Honda. Still there is no fruitful follow-up from Honda. there were no spare with Honda.
I was using Hyundai Verna earlier and changed to Honda in a good hope of Quality good services but this is what I am facing now.
Even write to Honda Japan, Customer care is not ready to accept the flaw with the glass. It’s a serious compliance issue which needs to be taken care by Quality check team from Honda.
I can be reached at XXXXXXXXXX

Exterior Superb, Stylish, Well designed. When you see it first itself it will impress you because of the sportive look with side liners.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Comfort to sit on back, OK with front. Great cabin space, well enough boot space. Without trouble 6ft can sit in front or back row. More than its competitor giving.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox No need to tell about engine. Amaze engine 18 to 20km
Ride Quality & Handling Very much comfartable to ride in city as well as highways. Nice to drive in low as well as high speeds (not crossed 100. But till 100 it was comfort)
Final Words Go for it. I did not find any major reason to reject or object this car.. Everything looks okay and has better quality than other cars in the market of similar range. Most importantly the service of Honda is much reliable. Its bit expensive but reliable. If you have accessible service centers then should not worry about service. I met many HONDA car owners  who came to book their second car from HONDA.

Full Review 
The car is good in look-and-feel, however there is a serious disregard to the customer safety, and in my experience Honda's post buy customer service is poor at best.
My Honda City is just 6 months old, and has been driven 3800 kms so far. I have just had 2 long (> 100 kms) trips with it. During my second trip, one of the tyres was burst while I was actually driving the car at 80 kmph (luckily we were unscathed), and I also saw that the other tyre in the front had a huge bulge developed in it. 
Upon following up with Honda about the issue, we were left with dealing with Goodyear directly. Only when a Goodyear engineer comes to the showroom (once a month), I had to bring my car there. Goodyear flatly denied having any manufacturing defects with the tyre. According to them, this has happened due to bad road condition (I was driving from Ahmedabad to Udaipur, the roads are really nice, actually), and it must have hit a huge hole.
The entire experience is harrowing, and there was no concern shown by Honda and GoodYear. Upon third party reviews, I found that the Goodyear tyres that come with Honda are of the most inferior quality. So, basically, in order to get better looks and getting a cheaper model out of the door, Honda is playing with customer safety!!
My finish line is : Buy only if you don't care about your life, and if you want to buy it neverthless -- for God's sake, spend extra 25000 more and get better tyres before you drive it out of the showroom!

Full Review 
Exterior Very upmarket and contemporary..Features like shark fin antena (though not that significant finctunally) add good value to the looks. Cuts and creases at right locations. A good musculine touch to the overall appearance. In short, this car is quite a head turner as compared to the competition in its segment.
Body metal sheets could have been a bit more sturdy..at present they seem to be a bit weak. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Spacious and luxurious...Fairly good space available for front as well as rear seats. Its great that the bump on the rear footboard minimal and hence makes the rear seat quite comfortable for 3 persons.
Surerb instrumentation panel. The dials, touch screen AC, in built 5" screen...Overall..a very well composed dash board.
Though, the piano black finish for dashboard looks premium, but its make even a slight of dust or fingure print marks distinctly visible and has to be cleaned very often. The worst fear is that it is prone to some scratches over longer usage. Hope that honda team has the right solutions for the scratches.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performs well at higher speeds (above 70-80 mark)..But the vibrations are noticable at lower speeds and higher RPM...well the strange fact is that the vibrations and noise is not constant. They errupt out of no where and last for quite some time.
The car may not be ideal for the speeding enthusiasts, but it performs greatly at higher speeds and is quite comfortable at 120- 140 range. Gear Box is good and works well....Rather, best thins is that this car goes 100KM/Hr at just 2000rpm on 6th gear..and thats what helps in achieving a good fuel economy.
I have driven this for around 1600 km in last 3 weeks (majorly on highways)..its showing the average of 22.1 Km/litre of fuel.
Ride Quality & Handling Good suspension, nice steering (its ideal and optimum for usage on highways or within city traffic).
Honda guys have worked well on the ground clearance aspect and this car definitely is showing great results. unlike its earlier versions, tt rides clear of quite tall speedbreakers. 
Final Words Good car. Value for money in all aspects.
Areas of improvement Will be great of music system remote control is provided for rear passegner. Also features like GPS can definitely add further value to the overall package.

Full Review 
Exterior - Looks of new city is very good, so many people complemented my car " its looking great"
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) - Features like cruise control, touch auto A/c, stearing controls, rear A/C vents and speadometre are good but i didnt like the music player as in the the version I took there is no CD player instead they only gave a USB and AUX with bluetooth but no CD player.
Space- one of the main truimph card for this new city is space, huge rear leg room and three adult can seat comfy at rear and the ambience of the car adds up with its rich feel.
Comfort - Very good seats and legroom, I love driving a lot but in this new city my fav place is at the rear, its just like some good SOFA, very comfortable car but the ride quality spoils some of its great comforts.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox-  every review is complaining there is lot of engine noise audible inside the cabin but I dont agree, In new city I heard very less noise for a D- engine. Fuel economy is g8t I got arround 23 to 24  on Highway and overall I got around 21 KMPL. Gearbox is good I cant complain
 
Ride Quality & Handling- The major drawback lies here, previous city has a problem of hiting its bottom to spead breakers, to rectify it honda installed a stiff suspension and the problem of bottom hitting got reduced but due to that stiff suspension  there is a lot of vertical push on bad roads and little push on highways, due to this the whole rich fealing of the car is going away. So, I say comfort is great inside on good roads but on bad roads I got little bit of Back ace. 
 
Final Words - To rectify the problem of cars bottom thudding over bumps and speed breaker Honda created a new issue I.e spoiling the ride quality, Im happy that my car bottom hits the road rather I get a back ace due to its stiff suspension. If honda offers any soft suspension I will replace it with its current suspension. Apart from this issue every other aspect is a GOLD. I love my New Honda City

Full Review 
Exterior
 I liked the previous version also However new one has more sober but stylish front. Back view is the best. Side view is same like earlier other than side linings.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Interior is where Honda beats every other car. Fully loaded, lots of features, Except 5" monitor and rear parking video and alloy wheel as not available with SV version. However true value for money. I would recommended to have rear parking sensor from Delaer as it is of good quality along with extended warranty.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine performance is very linear, you will never feel the lack of power however for petrol city lovers bit disappointing as unlike IVTEC engine, immediate surge in power is missing. May be because Engine is tuned for better efficiency. In initial 410 Km, Car is showing efficiency of 21.6 however i still need to calculate manually. (Update1 Feb 18, 2014: Total km- 1800; Econoly- 21.6 km/l). During Highway driving recently, i have achieved economy of 23.7 km/l (By autocut method). (Update 2; May 09, 2014: Total km- 3200; Econoly- 21.3 km/l). 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Suspension are little stiff but once Car reaches >30 km/h, Ride is very smooth. Handling at corner is very good. I moved from Hatch back to City but not feeling any difference in cutting corners etc. Also not facing any problem of under scrapping at bumps (commendable work from honda Engineers)
Final Words
 Till present, very happy with my decision. Hopes it stays as it is in Future and service cost remain in control. 
Areas of improvement  
 Some small feaures should be provided in SV model i.e. remote trunk opener etc. There is no covering provided for trunk top from inside as it looks ugly with open spaces and wires. The reading light is provided at rear side only.

 good looks sporty and design is similar to the Honda Civic,the finishing work is very great minor defects are visible if examined closely,There is no question about the looks it looks very good
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 the interior is dissappointing, not leg space in the front,the comfort level is not as i would have liked it to be,the previous City was better in terms of space
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 the diesel engine is not as well adapted compared to the petrol variants,the fuel economy is good but that does not mean the car is great 
Ride Quality & Handling
 is average
Final Words
 dissappointed with the New city could have been much better,i wouldnt advive people to buy it ,expected a lot but got not much rather a car which looks great from the outside but the inner thing is lacking 
Areas of improvement  
 needs a lot of improvement in the interior,it looks great from the outside poor from the inside

Exterior: It looks fabulous and eye turner.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Rich in features, Sitting space and comfort. Touch screen AC, Cruise control, lavish sitting style in a mid segment saloon is the beauty of the car.
However, if we look into space for keeping material inside, we get confused. I had rear screen, two pillows and one tissue paper box to be kept in the rear. I could not find space for these items. the glass (rear wind screen) is so much tilted that in case you put the screen, you can't keep the pillows. And adjusting tissue paper box in between the pillows is again a herculean task. You have to put a wellcrow tape to fix the box, and the best part is that the dealer presents you with a tissue paper box when you purchase the car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Engine performance is good for fuel economy. I have done 2000+ kms till now and was able to get 22+ milage on Highway (80%)/city conditions. Gearbox is noisy. It creates a big sound while changover. The engine is quite noisy. It equals my earlier 6 year old Logan at this point itself. Don't know what will happen later. Yes one thing the car has started smoothening after running for this distance.
Car's system had malfunctioned last time when I had moved out of city. I was not able to get proper assistance in city away from NCR. Though the problem disappeared after a day, yet I was told to get the system scanned when back in town. To my amazement the scanning system at dealer end was found defective last Saturday when I visited him. Have to see when it will get repaired and they will recall my vehicle to attend. Else will have to raise the issue as it may give issues to my car later. 
Ride Quality & Handling Ride and handling is too good and overcomes the issues that we face in engine noise and space.
On highways, in case you want to boost the speed, you will find it dull as it starts caring for the fuel economy.
Final Words: Good car to have.
Areas of improvement  Honda should have improved that engine noise, material space and speed boost also in addition to the name (of the car) and fuel.

Full Review 
Exterior
Exterior wise the car is good. Although I liked the previous front grill they had in previous honda. Still it looks superab in terms of looks
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Spacious and comfortable inside. Boot space is really good. Especially the touch system for air-conditioner is very elegant. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Reverse gear shift is hard due to incorporation of 6th gear. Engine noise is high within the cabin.
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride quality is good but not as good as previous petrol Honda cars.   
Final Words
Honda definitely needs to improve on noises within the cabin. Otherwise with the new features like Cruse control and Bluetooth connectivity, airbags in all variants they are definitely looking to capture the market, it’s just that small corrections they need to make at their end to be market winners.
Areas of improvement  
The in-built deck needs improvement; within three days of delivery of the vehicle my display got lines. Engine and horn noise within the cabin space is really high.

 Overall good exterior, Paint Quality is not so good, Looks are personal choice.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
spacious, Comfortable, rear AC vents are showpeice only, Seat Belt warning is annoying, Side pillers vibrates on loud music which is very annoying. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Sometimes noisy and sometimes calm. good isulation, Gears are smooth
Ride Quality & Handling
 Overall good and comfortable if you are a calm driver Not that zoooom feeling.
Final Words
 I was saisfied with car till 2 months of purchase, thenafter my front suspension started producing noise. Ivisited Landmark honda Jamnagar, They checked and told me not to worry and asked for 2-3 days to diagnose the problem. I kept my car for three days, the issue was solved and i brought my car. But again after 2 days the noise started again when i talked to dealer they again asked to bring the car. My place is 160 km away form the nearest dealer and i already visited 3 times for same issue, still they are not able to diagnose the problem, No responce of my mail on Lanmark honda website. I already wested diesel of rs 4000 for the issue which the honda engineers not able to solve.  
Areas of improvement  
Honda should appoint competant staff and should improve after sales service.

 New city has excellent exterior, it looks like Verna model, looks great, it would be great if they are providing alloy wheels in all the segments
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 It has Excellent interior, You have sufficient boot space, Rear AC system is great, and dashboard looks stunning, must say one of the best interios in the recent times, Music player and sound system also really good
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Completely satisfied with the Engine performace and Fuel Economy, Gear is bit difficult intially guess it will be same for all the cars, i have tried max speed of 140 and car has no issues, going very smoothly
Ride Quality & Handling
 I really liked the quality of the ride, it is not giving any discomfort
Final Words
 Definately one of the best cars in Honda City, 4th Generation City will be the best in all the generations, Verna will find extremely difficult to match with the new HondA City.
Areas of improvement  
 Foglamp, Reverse Camera needs to be given all the variants, as this became mandatory, ground clearance also has to be improved.
But I love this car

This is mr 3rd Honda City after the 1st Gen 2001, 2nd Gen 2005 and now the 4th gen 2014. The car has improved in all areas from the 2nd gen car. 
Very unlike Honda, I am experiencing some teeething troubles with the car. There is a rattle in the dash board wich could not be rectified by the dealer. The auto door lock sensor goes crazy sometimes and keep locking/unlocking the car over rough roads and bumps. I am among the first few owners when it was launched and this could explain the teething troubles.
The centre arm rest is not mush use and a slider versions ( like the civic ) would be useful. Seat Back pockets are sorely missed in the V grade. 16" rims with 185 tires would be ideal and look nicer. 
Space, Ride & handling, Steering feedback, Drive& Engine, Fuel efficience are all great and already much discussed.

Exterior
 Attractive curve and body design but not happy with front grill looks it's not attractive should remove broad chromate wings surrounding the "H" logo.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Very spacious and all necessary features like Cruze control etc.But feel that two airbags should start from S variant.Tou h screen audio system control makes it very comfortable to operate. The horn seems to be hard and is positioned at the centre of the steering wheel sometimes I have to apply lot of force.
Missing is remote of audio system. Rear AC vent is another useful feature. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Smooth gear shift but clutch is hard people say diesel car clutch is hard coated to petrol.
This diesel engine is powerful and moves well on highway.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride is smooth and handling is excellent don't feel the pot holes .
Final Words
Best diesel sedan in its segment with excellent mileage.
 
Areas of improvement  
 May be work on hard clutch.

Full Review 
Exterior Nothing great; the side view mirrors are shock proof they say.  the doors were found poorly aligned, I had to really take it up seriously to get them corrected,  window shields waves during closure, excessive door bounce while shutting, poorly designed remote key as it opens up while is  trouser pocket without touching the keys ( there shoud have been a lock position for the buttons to stay inert until we press them).
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)  good rear seat legroom, the inner lining of the ceiling is of lowest quality and finishing, which I never expected. the speakers are good with hi-fidelity. The dealer capital honda avoids fixing the floor mats after every service, even though i got it after paying rs.8000.  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I own a iDTEC. Pickup is reasonable, fuel economy is overstated - i get only 20kmpl in city and hwy both, gear box not condusive for a smooth ride; the rubber flap cover near the hand brake has a lot of gap that even coins, metal keys  or such items can easily fall and get thru to the gear box assy below, the gap between the front seat ( L or R ) and central handbrake assy is very small that even if mobile phone or something like this falls, you cannot take them out easily.
Ride Quality & Handling It thows you up and down when you meet bumps and patches on the road. nothing to mention about pot holes you can imagine.  at the hwyway drive, the car throws up while driving over the road patches, not experienced with my honda exi city earlier.
Final Words I had the petrol city exi for 8 years. I never complained on it except for the occasional service issues. That is a lower drive quality and poor hard shock absorbers.  
Areas of improvement There is a difference between economical and cheap design. The dealer service quality is  not up to the mark of satisfaction currently with capital honda as i had to really talk to all levels to get a job done. They took my car before and after water service, thru the rainwater muddy sludge; currently the issues are under discussion wtih capital honda who has told me that they will raise the isse with honda mfrng to resolve my issues. afraid of getting the car serviced by such dealer since their insensibility to address issues should not results on our life.

Exterior
 Low ground clearance. So, very difficult in spoiled roads. The under covers are not fit properly and comes out often. The front bumper comes out even for any small impact, say like street dogs. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Spacious with good air condition, good looking and comfortable seats
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Pick up, especially in 2nd gear is very poor. Engine gets off if we move with second gear. Engine noise increases (I can clearly see difference in 10,000 km and in 30,000 km). The company had used worst tyres (good year) as they are very cheap. 3 of my tyres got bursted in various occations. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Low suspension and difficult on spoiled roads. Low ground clearance and the under covers on the engines are low and comes off often as they are not placed properly. They had use plastic screws which worn out often. Very low braking compared to Volkswagen.
Final Words
 Ok type car for this segment at this price. 
Areas of improvement  
 Braking should be improved, good tyres should be used, engine pick up, especially in 2nd gear should be improved, suspension can be improved.

Ride Quality & Handling Very poor ride. You will feel every bump on the road which you never though existed whne driving other cars in this category.
Final Words Not worth  buying a diesel.the petrol may be quiter but the suspension is really bad. must do a test drive to believe it. the diesel Cars have also been recalled due to faulty fuel line that may sieze the engin !! wow. Also the service in chennai  (sundaram motors are useless) it has been more than a week and no one has come to take the cars to get redone after the floods in chennai.Yes it is busy as a lot of cars have been affected  but I do have other cars like a tata who came withing three days.
Areas of improvement Service is non-existant in chennai and suspencion is compairable to a maruti 800..very unrefined and noisy engine.

Ride Quality & Handling is ok but feels under powered on slopes.
Final Words Better options are availabe in market.
Areas of improvement  after sale service. service center in Gurgaon wanted me to pay in advance for broken right side back view mirror and they will procure it in few days and then i revisit and get it installed. other customers were also complaining about the same. we are asked to pay for parts (except consumables) in advance and then they want to procure and replace.. rediculas. never faced this with my Maruti and Tata cars. it is understandabe for components which rarely need replacement but for a rear view mirror???
I think Honda is going to loose market share, for sure.

Exterior Front and back the look is awesome.  Not even a single member of family or friends had a complaint on this area.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Spacing and Comfort very high. Comfortable back seat knee spaces if awesome for long journeys.  Current marketno  SUVs cannot beat this area.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Dont expect it to revup like sport car very quickly. But is decent. I'm just loving my car. Already drobe 1900Kms.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride is smooth, Engine noise is minimal. Need to check after couple of services again. Steering controls are user friendly. Cruise is good feature but Indian roads one might need to be careful as there will many distractions on highways.
Ground clearance is one serious negative mark I feel. I dont want my 12 lakh City touch/hit the ground during bumpy roads n truns. It realy hurts me.
Final Words Worth a Purchase. I'm thorughly enjoying it and would recomend others.
Areas of improvement Ground clearance.
Additional features from higher ends should be available on the alacarte basis to fit. Not all of them are available for additional fitting. The accesories need to be more friendly to the customer to enocurage the sale.

Full Review 
Disclaimer : I am not an expert for writing Car reviews. Just putting down my thoughts and experience with my New Honda City I-Dtec, bought recently
 
Exterior
 Exterior of the Car is decent, H design implemented gives it a distinct edge over its previous version and rear look is astonishing. Front grill has been changed from 3 segment grill to a broad single piece grill. Styling as well as finishing of front grill is not as good as it was in previous version. This is the area which i think have a great scope of improvement. (3 star for exterior is largely due to front look, else it could have been 4 or 5) 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Interior, as per me, is the USP of new honda City. Feather touch A/C control system, Wide screen music system, well mixed interior, Sunroof (feature only available in City, compared to its Peers in the class), dual colour LED light dial adds up to make its interior feel really rich. Honda has launched this car with More Man - Less machine concept and punch line is very appropriate. Interior as per me is 5/5.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Fuel Economy is good. Got mileage of 22 Km/l on highway,driving at a speed of 80-100 Kmph.To avoid knocking when accelerator pedal is released, Honda has set sort of cruise speed for each gear (this might be what they call i-dtec/i-vtec). for novice it could be a good option but for regular user this is bit annoying as speed dont reduce beyond certain limit on releasing accelerator pedal. Can feel engine noice inside the car but as I understand it is inherent property of diesel engine.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is good. Suspension has been made stiffer compared to older version to avoid car hitting bumps on the road. this has reduced comfort little bit but still is very much acceptable. Steering wheel is bit more smooth to give feel of a sturdy car. I am not more of a cruiser so wont be able to write more about handling at higher speeds
Final Words
Overall a good deal and Value for Money
Areas of improvement  
 For version with Alloy wheels, spare wheel is without alloy wheels. This is ridiculous way of cost cutting.When a person is spending 12+ lacks he could not expect this kind of cost cutting. Car seems to be designed for class who want to get car drove by Schauffer. A remote control for the music system would be much appreciated in such cases. Projector head lamp can be added to make feature list complete.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) No features like remote boot lid opener, cd player, etc there are a lot . it also don't have much road view but it could be manageable.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good in this segment. this segment should be appreciated. i like it the interier alot. I drived it of my friend and gets a regular update on it. maintance is also not much so this section is going on soon.
Ride Quality & Handling It is good. i liked the handling and also the ride quality at the rear.
Final Words Can't pay this money without these basic features unless gets some discount. I would love to take the SV segment if dealer gives me these basic features intalled in this car. don't need extra features but features like cd player, covered boot lid and fog lamps.
Areas of improvement Just features otherwise it is good. if someone has a lot of money it is could be a good option but honda has to think which customer they need ?

Exterior THE NEW HONDA CITY LOOKS VERY STYLISH & UNIQUE. IT'S LOOKS ARE MASCULAR & EYE-CATCHING. WHEN I DRIVE IT PEOPLE SEE MY CAR AGAIN & AGAIN. THE CHROME USED IN THE CAR MAKES IT VERY ROYAL. IT'S HEADLAMPS & TAILLAMPS BOTH LOOKS VERY BEAUTIFUL. THE BEST THING THAT  I LIKED ABOUT THIS CAR IS THE SHARK FIN ANTENNA WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN IT'S OPPONENTS.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) THE INTERIORS OF THE NEW CITY ARE VERY PLUSH & THE SEATING IS VERY COMFORTABLE. THE LEG SPACE IS THE BEST-IN-CLASS. THE MATERIAL USED IN THE CAR IS OF GOOD QUALITY. THIS CAR IS FULLY-LOADED WITH ALL THE FEATURES WHICH ONE NEEDS IN SUCH TYPES OF SEDAN. THERE ARE ALSO SOME FEATURES IN THIS CAR WHICH  YOU WILL NOT IMAGINE OF GETTING IN  THE SEDANS OF THIS SEGMENT.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox MY HONDA  CITY HAS A 1.6 LITRE  DIESEL ENGINE WHICH GENERATES 100 PS POWER GIVING AN UNBELIEVEABLE MILEAGE OF 26.6 KMPL. IT'S GEARBOX HAS 6 GEARS WHICH IS VERY SMOOTH.
Ride Quality & Handling THE RIDE QUALITY OF THE NEW CITY HAS NOW BEEN IMPROVED & IT IS VERY CONVIENIENT IN TERMS OF HANDLING. 
Final Words THIS CAR IS DEFINITELY THE BEST. IT IS TRUELLY A STATUS SYMBOL & IT HAS BEEN AGAIN THE SEGMENT LEADER.  I AM VERY THANKFUL TO MR. SOICHIRO  HONDA, FOUNDER OF HONDA MOTOR CO. FOR MAKING SUCH AN INCREDIBLE CAR.
Areas of improvement I THINK THERE ARE NO AREAS WHERE THERE IS A NEED FOR IMPROVEMENTS.

sixteen years and three generations later, Honda has finally given in to the country’s demand for a diesel engine. It’s also packed this latest iteration with a tonne of features – something we Indians love. The diesel City may have missed the sweet spot when it comes to timing, but it definitely beats not turning up at all. So how good is the new ‘consumer-oriented’ City? We thoroughly tested both, the petrol and the diesel manuals, to see if it sets new benchmarks yet again.

Full Review 
Exterior Do I need to explain anything on this??? Everybody knows its complete aerodynamic shape makes it more attractive and beautiful car available in market. The features which I like the most is rear end of car and shark fin antenna...takes the car to upper level.  Addition to this I would like mention here is that this is the first car which has got engine under body tray. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are excellent. The moment you get into the car you will feel the quality difference of dashboar plastics, door trim, seats, every this is made up of top quality material. Talking more about the features the blue multi informational display is very good and provide sufficient required information at all time. The feature which delights me a lot is touch screen automatic climate control system.
Space and Comfort:- Ha Ha Ha second row seat is place where actually you should be. Sufficient leg room and head room. just pull down the arm-rest and enjoy the ride in very relaxed mode.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Hmmmm... Here comes bit of disappointment. I found acceleration is the area where car is lacking behind (I am talking about only diesel engine car only) otherwise everything is just perfect. Smooth diesel engine. Very good fuel economy. I am getting 21-22 Kmpl in city and on highway its 23-24 kmpl (these values are from MID) Gearbox is smooth and easy to shift the gears.
Ride Quality & Handling NVH levels are reduced significantly as compared to Amaze. But yes you will get the feel always that under the hood there is diesel engine is there. Improved GC makes the car to cross the speed bakers with ease. Suspension is very good. At low speed or even at high speeds the car just glides over the pot-holes.
Handling: - it’s just perfect. Smooth and light steering gives you much more confidence on higher speeds as well, even above 100 kmph.
Final Words If you are looking for smooth, steady drive with comfort then go for SV Diesel and if you want to have some fun on highways then don’t you dare to look at diesel version because petrol. It’s simply the best. 
Areas of improvement Basic feature like 'Map light' should be provided for all variants.

Ride Quality & Handling Driven 3000 km with this car and it makes you feel like a king its smooth, stabe handling.

Exterior: Good
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): No comfort, it jumps on every speed breaker & every pit on the road which shakes your body & neck. Seems shockers are extremely poor. My car is 2 months old & i am extremely frustrated
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Horrible, understand what it means by 26km/litre. Honda commit 1500rpm @60km constant speed. Else it is not going beyond 17 & you may also get 14 km/litre. You feel cheated
 
Ride Quality & Handling: Ride experience extremely painful & i prefer my Accent over this horrible drive. I personally don't recommend if you looking for Ride quality
 
Final Words: NO NO. Don't buy else you will repent. Two keys reasons: ZERO comfort inspite i placed extra cushions & padding. Mileage is damm poor nothing more than 15km/litre for city ride
 
Areas of improvement: No point of buying as its no value for money. Even Honda representative had no explaination inspite running check on mileage

Exterior
 Good Look
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Interiors in SV give a feeling of cheap plastic when compared with Skoda and Verna in similar range. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Gearbox is too hard. Bluetooth mic doesn't work and showroom says you need to speak at the top of your voice for the other person to hear your voice. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Pick up is not as good. For example,  If the speed reduces to 40KMPH in traffic and you are running in 5th or even 4thgear, car will not pickup until you bring down the gear to 3rd. I did not realise it in test drive and pickup seem OK but realised it while driving in daily traffic conditions.
Final Words
I have bought the SV model just 20 days back and realised these issue. Mainly the bluetooth mic located in the stereo body due to which your voice is not clear and too low for the hearing party.  When i spoke with dealer i got to know that the test drive was given in V, where the mic is in roof. The dealer changed the stereo twice and now its been changed by the sterio vendor but problem remains the same. Its a basic feature which doesn't work and Honda doesn't take responsibility of improper information and poor qaulity even when multiple issue have been raised since 2014.

 It is good 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Driver seat is not comfortable for city and long drives. While Driving the car the clutch is positioned a way too high and hard . I drive daily 50 kms through the Delhi jam packet roads and my feets are feeling the pain. Driver seat doesnt provide support to thighs esp to tall people .
Door rubber comes out which of my old care never separated from door.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine is ok, pick up is poor to say , if u accelerate ur economy goes down. Within in 11000km gears behave like 50k kms have done...not smooth. Horn within 4 months horn sometimes honks sometimes not,
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride Quality ok, At above 80 kms speed , care sways with light breeze of air also, quite dangerous
Final Words
 Its not the Honda quality we used to knw , its poor to say.. I feel cheated, as hard earned money is sort of wasted. 
Areas of improvement  
 Clutch positioning and hardness , /materials usedin interiors ,need to stablise the car .

The smoothness of the drive is best, The road grip is awesome,even at 120  speeds you feel the smothens of the drive.
Areas of improvement Ground clearence can be improved, since its not sensible to expect indan roads to improve.

Exterior Nice, but not as attractive as Hyundai Varna. Further improvement is possible. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space and comfort is best in class but some featuers pinch you on every ride like. Toxic smell (even afetr 10,000 KM, smell was there, fortunatly it's gone after 10 months).
Ground clearance.
Pick up - initial pick up is very bad. 
Engine Noise - As compaired to Maruti Dzire cabine noise is high.
Side View Mirror - Hyundai is offering Power folding side View mirror in I 20 and Verna. Even reflector is not provided on 2nd top model. 
Music System: - Sab standard. Need imrpovement 
Tail Light: - LED type light should be provided.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox  Good engine performance but lacking in initial pick up.
Ride Quality & Handling Excilent ride and handling is very easy.
Final Words Good Car but can be better.

 styling is elegant
its the same with polo and vento thats a big setback there should be a a difference that people can see 
one good thing is that volkswagen doesnt keep badges based on trims like other car brands like Vxi V S etc
thats actaully good as most of the premium car manufatures doeant do that 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 interors doesnt look so attractive but they are really comfortable but you get very less features.
the AC knobs and other things are just strong enough to sustain a long time. there are no bells and wistles here like that of city touch screen AC ,imagine your hands begin wet will the AC work then ???
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
A++++++++ the geabox stores your driving patterns and adjusts accordingly.....the gearbox is the main attraction for the car 
Ride Quality & Handling
 driven the car @ 200 ... just stable at the edge of it limit. suspension is good 
Final Words
 The car is really good,thought of buying honda city but belive there sucess of increasing number of sales has got into there heads...verna is bad with ride quality and the left options were vento and rapid ...skoda is not good in service department so finally gone to volkswagen vento TDI DSG HIGHLINE
Areas of improvement  
service cost should be reduced and competative features should be updated in parallel to other cars

Exterior Good Exterior and gives a nice look from outside
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Not spacious and my head is hitting the roof while entering into driving seat and in exit even though my height is < 6feet..I am using a Dzire which is very comfortable in terms of space.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel Economy is below average.Company offers 20.64 but getting < 15.
Ride Quality & Handling Need gear changing whenever you apply brake. 
Final Words I bought a New Vento in Aug'2015.Within 2 months of use the wheels and some inner parts started rusting and I reported this matter to the dealer KTC,Cochin.I was surprised with their response as they said it's common in VW cars and nothing to worry.But when I insisted on solution they said they want to consult with the company and they need the vehicle in their custody for 2-3 days to discuss with their plant..This is again shocking as they don't care about the inconvenience to the customer by keeping the vehicle in their custody just for the discussion with their plant.They said plant will ask lot of quieries and they want the vehicle to be in their workshop till the discussion is over..Why the customer has to suffer for their inefficiency which I don't understand..Also the mileage is very poor.The company offers 20.64 but getting nearly 12 to 13 in city and 16 -18 in highways.
Areas of improvement Need lot of improvements in Customer Service infact I had faced an unfair trade practise from the dealer.After lot of follow ups I got the refund of excess money collected by the dealer. I did a blunder by buying this New Vento and plan to dispose off.

THE WORST SERVICE OF RENAULT.
I AM USING RENAULT FLUENCE AND IT HAS GOT A BREAK PROBLEM AND I KEPT MY CAR AT MANGALORE SERVICE STATION TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. I GOT A CALL FROM THE SERVICE STATION SAYS THAT THE DRUM AS TO BE REPLACE AND IT TOOK 2 WEEKS FOR THE PART TO COME FROM CHENNAI TO MANGALORE BUT THEY COULDNT RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ABS SYSTEM AS GONE AND IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER 2 WEEKS FOR THAT PART 2 COME DOWN. NOW ITS ALMOST A MONTH, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT WITH THE BREAK DRUM OR ABS SYSTEM. THEY STILL CANT RECTIFY WHATS THE PROBLEM IS. I EVEN CALLED HEAD OFFICE AT CHENNAI CUSTOMER CARE MUMBAI BUT TILL NOW NO RESPONSE FROM ANY ONE.
MY ADVICE TO EVERY ONE PLZ NOT TO BUY RENAULT CARS COZ THEY ARE NOT EVEN BOTHER ABOUT THE SERVICE AFTER THE SALES.

During service your pocket will be empty. For normal routine service you have to pay Rs18000/
If you have any problem they will charge minimum Rs20000/- Milage also very bad. Behaviour of service cetre is like that as if you have done the mistake buying their model. 
There are very few service centre available and they are doing monopoliy.
I will not suggest to buy renault fluence to any one. Even for other model also buyer has to keep in mind that there will be costly maintenance in range of three times of other equivalant vehicle.

First of all efficient and economical service. Company also train there service representative. They should understand their existance is depend on our choise. They should not feel that we have purchase the vehicle means we are under their wish. Company should take it very seriously other wise thay will be out of market. Their branding is not so posotioned that they should behave like this.

Exterior Good. Strong body very robust and safe not like japanese or korean cars. Looks are different and good to look.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Excellent leg space all features are present only auto box is missing. it s got cruise control which is very helpful on highways. a/c is very effective even  in 38deg c
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine power is decent , could have better. at speeds of 100-120 you get upto 18kmpl in highways with ac. clutch is bit hard in city conditions. A very reliable highway cruiser.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling is very good. Ride quality one of the best cars inthe segment. service cost is 10000 per service for every 10k kms.over rough patches you do not feel anythingi n the cabin.
I have driven 20000 kms in a year. Absolutely fine. done two oil change service.
Final Words Happy with the car would suggest eveyone intrested  to buy a car in this segment to have a look at fluence. a very under rated car.

Full Review 
I love my vehicle, they have made an excellent piece of art and I appreciate it, I have been using it from 2011 and it has been 5 years of sheer pleasure. But on the way there were small painful hurdles made painful because of the long duration.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interiors are durable, they really last the drill. excelptions are the door handles and the music system, they get scratched if you touch them with your fingernails.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is good and is better with the newer models, fuel economy depends on your service center guy they can tweak the engine a lot and that can change everything. Gearbox is smooth and excellent.
Ride Quality & Handling Its smooth as an airplane and handling is as easy as driving a maruti 800.
Final Words Buy Fluence and Pray that everything goes well.
Areas of improvement Spares Spares! small spares!! especially in Mysore. Break cables, wipers, batteries fro key, floor mats, small interior light bulbs, none of them are available! You have to drive down to nearest metro city to get them. Service is poor and not helpful. All they know to do is Replace. An exageration would be asking the customer to replace the door if the door lock is damaged! :)
Renault could relook into the attitude of the serive dealers. Whether every replacement they do is actually necessary? If customers feel that a company resorts to earn more through service than the product itself then may be it is not very good idea to go purchase even if the product is good. (just like maruti).

Exterior Great Interiors, with stylish and aerodynamic design. Great DRLs (accessory)
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very spacious and premium interiors.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Unbeleivable output from 1.4 lire diesel engine. Gears are perfectly calibrated. Mileage is decent.
Ride Quality & Handling Great. Great handling when on high speeds.
Final Words I have been in doubt for its low powered engine. I drive to himachal twice a month and its drive is very smooth in the hills too. Have been to intriors of himachal too (kinaur) with no issues. Just keep in mind that perfect rpm should be maintained in order to keep going. :). And great mileage too. (17kmpl city and 21kmpl highway). 
I have done around 8k kms till writing this review. Well lets see what it delivers in the future.
Areas of improvement Some features should be intriduced in next generation, e.g sunroof, auto close side mirrors in low models too (come on, m spending around 15-16 lakh).

Exterior The car looked great.  My children and I preferred Metallic Grey as we felt the car looked like a robot in that colour.  I saw many people turn their heads to our direction whenever we drove.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The seats looked great when I saw the through car from outside.  The seats are very spacious.  My son was very happpy because he could sit comfortably for longer time over a long distance.  He used to complain earlier when we had driven a smaller hatchback.  My daughter was in big smile when she travelled longer distance because there was no travel fatigue.  In summary, the quality of journey or comfort in Toyato Corolla has been Impeccable.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I bought a new Diesel Corolla Altis (Model:  D-4D JS) in June 2015. In fact, I had booked for a Jetta Comfortline Diesel with a waiting time of 2 months; but after the waiting time, Jetta dealer said that I had to wait for another 8 months!!   Though disappointed, I spent two days to find an alternative to Jetta.   I narrowed my choice to Toyota Corolla. So, I called Annamalais Toyota located in Karur Dt, Tamil Nadu immediately  and expressed my tentative interest.  To my surprise, the Toyota Representatives brought a Corolla Diesel same day evening to my residence at Manapparai for a test drive.
I tested this car on a 40 km stretch of Trichy - Manapparai Highway. My  initial impression about engine performance was that the car was very comfortable in the speed range 100 - 130 kmph with good stability. I also drove the car in lower speeds at 40 kmph.  My conclusion was that it was a practical car meeting my requirements.  Toyota Representatives assured that the expected mileage would be about 20 kmpl. Since I normally drive in the range 100 - 120 kmph range and since I felt the car was practical I decided to buy the Toyota Corolla Altis. Needless to say the positive role played by Toyota Representatives also helped a lot to decide in favor of Toyota.
In the first two 2 months, I drove  my Toyota Corolla Altis car for about 2500 km. I was driving at a speed of 30 - 40 kmph locally and at a speed of 100 - 120 kmph on highways. The car was slightly sluggish in the top gear when I wanted to race from 80 kmph to 100 kmph in the sixth gear and the car was clicking a mileage of about 18.4 kmpl. However, the performance of the car began to improve  once I crossed 5000 km in my odometer. Meanwhile, I also understood the car better and began to shift the gear appropriately to the required speed. Since then, the car has been an absolute delight to drive. The car was  responding much better, after crossing 5000 km, and pickup from  80 kmph to 120 km was effortless in the same sixth gear. Now the car has been clocking 23.5 kmpl on highways and 18.5 on local roads thus giving 20.4 kmpl cumulative.  Once I competed with Jetta TDI on a Highway and I found my Corolla Diesel was responding with a speed of 140 kmph giving a mileage of 18 kmpl; I was shifting between 4th and 5th gear.
In Nov 2015, during my recent Diwali  trip from Manapparai, Trichy District to Salem, the car was loaded 75% full with the occupancy of 4 persons, including the driver, the car ran in rainy weather with a speed of 110-120 kmph. The car clicked a mileage of 21 kmpl.
The return trip from Salem to Manapparai  was in the morning hours with two persons and there was no  rain this time. I maintained a speed of 80-90 kmph. The car clicked 28.1 kmpl for a distance of 100 km up to Karur. (Unable to paste the picture that recorded 28.1 kmpl).  When I reached Manapparai, after completing about 190 km, the car clicked a mileage of 25.6 kmpl, which I consider extremely good. The odometer reading was about 7000 km.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality is impeccable as I have very less drive fatigue over long distance travelling.
Final Words A luxurious car with good mileage.  The car can give respectable pick-up in the 4th and 5th gear as well as good mileage in the 6th gear.
Areas of improvement The Steering  of Corolla is not as responsive as Jetta. There is lot of scope to improve in this area particularly at low speed, 30 - 40 kmph. When I take the car for 10000 km service,  I hope this problem willbe addressed by Toyota Engineers.

Exterior Simple but elegant . I've got the 2014 model. The new one is'nt much different...People say that it looks like its sibling Vento .. But no , It actually looks like its Cousins , of the Audi Family!
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Highly Comfortable. Lacks sunroof (does'nt matter me !). Plenty of knee room ! The dealer offered a Blaupunkt car system, which solved all the issues of lacking Rear view camera,Bluetooth Handsfree calling etc. which the Comfortline lacks.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Words cant describe it . Just WoW ! City : 13km/l . Highway : 17.5km/l.
Ride Quality & Handling Just awesome!
Final Words Its just a superb car with A4 styling and A3 engine. Go for it ! Its worth what you spent for !!!! No doubt.
Areas of improvement None. But to say,  Good but expensive service every year.

Bought a 2015 Audi A3 a little over a month ago. Great car, but having problems with the navigation MMI already. Tells me that the car is somewhere I am not, and doesn't catch the speed traps which all other Audi's do here in Korea. Took it to AUDI KOREA service center twice and they can't figure it out. Basically told me I am out of luck. This is of course AFTER taking my car our for a 44 km joy ride and unplugging the black box so there would be no evidence (expect for my empty gas tank). I just hope Audi Headquarters finds a solution to fix the MMI because the AUDI KOREA dealership and service center are incompetent and horrible. Please hire employees that know how to fix their own products they represent. Audi's brand is being tainted and definitely will not be having repeat customers. Will NEVER recommend an Audi to anyone in Korea. Just horrible customer experience and there are long blogs with complaints from Audi owners. Should have read the blogs before buying. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND REGRETFUL AUDI OWNER!!!

Bought an Audi A3 - 2.0 TDI Attraction from Audi Bhopal 4 months back.
While the price on road was quoted as 28.5 lakhs in websites I was shown a paper in showroom stating that it costs 30 lakhs. Not knowing that I have to bargain like in a fish market I asked for a discount & was told that I will be given a 1 lakh discount plus additional 50,000 less for doctor's. But only after buying did I know that the showroom was selling it for around 24 - 25 lakhs only.
The sales executive hardly knew anything about the specifications of the car & while I insisted that I want Michelin tyres he said he will try for it but promised me that the car will come with either Michelin, Bridgestone or Continental tyres but was delivered with Dunlop tyres which gets punctured or in fact gets torn in every pothole. After a lot of struggle with them changed it to Continental Premium Contact 5 but this also gets torn with stones & potholes frequently.
To change the torn tyres I have to take it to Indore 200 kms from Bhopal & stay there overnight since the company executive is only interested in closing down the shop sharp at 7:30 PM while the technician who has to change it is not available for the second half of the working monday. And they say in Audi authorised service centre that they have no facilities to repair the puncture but will have to change the tyre only. With all this excellent so called service I would be charged Rs. 19470 for 1 tyre while it costs only Rs. 8500 outside. In fact I changed both front tyres to Michelin for Rs. 9,600 each plus Rs. 400 for wheel balancing while the Audi service centre charges Rs. 5,800 for wheel balancing alone. I failed to understand the logic or maths involved in those calculations.
Exterior A smaller version of any other Audi sedan but with out projector or LED lights.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Rear seat space is really cramped. No rear A/C vent or boot access with hand rest/ cup holder assembly which along with so many other features was (false) promised by the executive as available in Attraction model while we test drived the premium model. Only black interiors available in Attraction with no leather seats. Automatic adjustable seats only for driver. Can't blame the company since I foolishly paid 28.5 lakhs for a 24 lakh car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox With almost the same engine as Jetta or Octavia, A3 is quicker because it is smaller & lighter with partially Aluminium based body.
Ride Quality & Handling Suspensions are not very soft - not gas filled for a car of this price while my Chevrolet Aveo had gas filled shocks for 7.1 lakhs on road. Bumpy ride with fair ground clearance for this segment. 
Final Words Strictly only for people with black money who can throw money into dust bin - let it be for purchasing or service. Please do not think about it if your money is hard earned.
Areas of improvement With this greedy mindset Audi India has nothing to improve except their mindset. They should close down their operations in India & do some illegal smuggling business so as to earn more money & satisty their money hunger.

Exterior Amazing! It has perfect lines and curves through the body and very good looking exterior Its just " AAAAAMMMMAAAZZZIIINNNGGG!!!!!"
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Mind Blowing Interior speacially Features. Framless windows, Dual Panaromic Sunroof, High ground clearence, Big 18 inch Tyres and the list of this vehicle of interior space everything is just MIND BLOWING!!! also for the rear acitve spoiler and the incredible boot this final 5 lakh premium on the normal 3 series is worth to buy.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 8 SPEED AUTOMATIC GEARBOX!! AHHH!!! Wow! the engine performence is as good as in other 3's and 5's. The fuel economy is also very very efficient to one.
Ride Quality & Handling This diffrenciates from a luxury car to a normal car. The ride quality is just amazing and just like in a BMW and also the handling is great.
Final Words Just One in all " Real SHEER DRIVING PLEASURE.
Areas of improvement  Just the Back of a gt which looks like a hatch.

Hi Team Jaguar,
It is very very disappointing to know that my dealing with a  brand like Jaguar ended up like this.
I had booked a Jaguar XF on the 17th October'2014 which was scheduled for delivery on the 21st October'2014. 21st October'2014 being Dhanteras is a very auspicious day, so i really wanted to buy the car on the same day. A 5 PM delivery was committed to me for the same. I got a call from the showroom at about 4.30 PM saying that there is some problem with the PDI at the warehouse at Khandsa, Gurgaon so the delivery will take some time and now the delivery was re-scheduled at 6-7 pm. At 7 pm i get telling me that the car delivery isn't possible today as there is some problem with the server. I was then committed the delivery the next day i.e. 22nd October'14 at 3.00 PM. Before 3 PM i got 4-5 calls from the showroom saying that the car is ready for delivery and they were waiting for me to come and pick it up. I requested my family to postpone all there plans for a couple of hours and come with me to collect the car. We reached the showroom at  4 PM with my family to take the delivery of the Jaguar XF. They asked me to wait for 10-15 and in the meanwhile they asked me to inspect the car which was parked outside the showroom for delivery. I inspected the car and everything seemed to be fine. I was asked to wait for another 15-20 mins after that. After 40-45 mins they told me that its gonna take sometime as there was some problem with the billing. I then asked my family to go back home and told them that i will call them once the papers are ready. I was made to wait for another 2 hours and at about 7.30 they tell me that they cant give the car to me today aswell. I was furious and higly disappointed. None of the managers had the basic courtesy to even come to me and tell me as to what the problem was. When i called for the manager i was told that none of them are available. I was then made to speak with a manager on the phone whom i asked to cancel my booking for the car. He pressurized me alot and then confirmed me the delivery on Diwali i.e. 23rd, October'14. The next day the guy called me up and again told me the same thing - "Sir, I cannot give you the car today as well as  we are not getting any approval".  I am really disappointed with the way things have gone the last week. Is this the way a brand like Jaguar is suppose to function?
Buying a freaking Tata Nano would have been better i guess. The company should shut down the showrooms and get into something which they can deliver and do something which is of its caliber. Kindly note please dont experiment with markets you cannot cater to.
Also note- the luxury market is beyond you!! you are better off selling of Tata Nano's than Jaguars and Range Rovers. The brand is highly incompetent.
Thank you for screwing my Diwali.
Thanks,
Karan.
