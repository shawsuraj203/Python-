This
is
my
first
car
and
I
have
just
learnt
car
driving

I
feel
very
comfortable
in
driving
this
car

got
confident
within
one
day
after
owning
this
car.
Its
too
smooth
to
drive.
I had
bought
this
car
for
5
42
500
with
Basic
Accessories

temp
number
and
insurance.
Since
VX
version
of
this
car
was
not launced
by
24th
August

2011
 LX
was
the
top
variant
by
that
time

so
I
missed
VX
vesion.
Pros:
1.
Mileage
-
I
got
mileage
of
15
kmpl
with
first
1000
kms


10
days
 out
of
which
200
kms
I
covered
with
1st
or
2nd
gear
while
learning.
The
maximum
speed
I
touched
was
90
kmpl
on
NH10
while
going
to
Sirsa
from
delhi.
I
feel
mileage
will
increase
when
I
will
be
more
experienced
in
driving.
2.
Spacious:
Car
is
spacious
enough
for
your
comfort.
Problems:
1.
AC
Belt
is
creating
a
lot
of
sound

Chrrrr..
 if
you
switch
on
the
AC
within
2
minutes
of
starting
the
Car

even
after
1st
service
it
was
not
fully
corrected

sound
is
reduced
to
some
level
 by
the 
Automobile
Sterling

Noida.
2.
The
side
strips
on
door
are
easily
removable

the
strip
locks
were
loose
at
the
time
of
delivery
and
I
had
asked
the
SalesPerson
to
get
is
corrected

they
just
affixed
the
same
using
elfy

after
2-3
days
the strips
again
got
detached
from
the
doors.
Service
from
Automobile
Sterling

Noida:
I
had
sent
the
Car
for
First
free
Service

they
didnt
charge
me
anything
but
after
delivery
of
the
vehicle
to
my
office

I
found
following
thing
which
they
didnt
correct:
1.
they
used
some
black
material
to
affix
the
strips

instead
of
repairing
the
locks
they
are
doing
some
"JUGAAD"

which
means
it
will
be
in
same
state
after
some
time.
2.
The
AC
Fan
Belt
is
still
noisy

Noise
reduced
to
some
level


We
dont
expect
such
sound
from
a
New
Car.
3.
The
vehicle
was
not
cleaned
properly
 even
I
had
told
the
points
of
dirt
to
the
driver

still
these
were
not
cleaned.

I
got
this
car
on
26th
June

2011.
I
have
used
it
for
close

2.5
months
and
have
done
upto
3500
kms.

Exterior

heads.
Very

Blinking
indicators
on

adds
the

to
the
royal

what
makes
a
person
go
for
this
car.

it

also
a
very

Ride
quality
is
decent

is
tough
especially
when
compared
to

The
power

is
hard
and
make
manuverability
difficult.
The
lever
on
the
foot
are
so
high
that
it
is
difficult
to
drive
for
long
distances.
Fittings
are
not
done
properly
and
the

system
is
of
budget

Don't

till

it

i
faced 
is
the

when
gear
goes
from

so
tata

cant
find
the
fault


compared

its
interior

a

even

tata

-18

go
for

if

Areas

It
need
vey
improvement
in
it

its
good
but
not
the
best

as
the
name
of
company
TATA
people
beleave
and
purchase
it
 snd
the
company
should
provide
them
more
facilities

I
was
not
thinking
that
this
company
will
launch
this
type
of
car.
so
bad.
Waht
we
can
say
is
it
is
good
but
the
car
is
not
giving
that
much
average
in
which
people
would
purchase
it

So
I
hope
from
the
company
that
you
will
se
my
message
and
try
to
improve
the
average
make
your
company
once
again
the
top
copmpanies
in
cars
also.
With
lots
of
hope
I
purchase
that
car
but
witthin
a
year
I
sold
it.
Next
problem
is
the
safety
problem.
It
does
no
have
air
bags
etc.
Many
baD
features
aur
there
so
you
may
improve
it
 
feeling
so
bad
to
have
this
dustbin
taxi
car
so
bad.

Review

Exterior
No
problem
at
all

since
my
car
is
parked
in
the
open
with
rains
and
sun
beating
on
it

Kerala
weather.
 But
everytime
I
wash
it

it
looks
like
new.
Good
paint
job.
 Panel
gaps
is
a
big

but
so
far
water
from
rain
has
not
gone
inside
the
car
or
dicky.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

I
brought
the
VX
Full
option
in
Nov
2011

Very
comfortable

it
is
because
I
have
the
full
option
version

the
seats
are
fabric
and
good.
I
use
the
car
for
very
long
distances

some
times
driving
3500-4000
km
at
a
stretch
Kerala
to
Mumbai

Nasik.
I
sleep
in
the
car
at
nights
in
the
back

very
comfortable.
The
plastics
could
be
better
though.
But
then
when
I
pay
Rs.
6.04
laks
for
this
full
option

I
dont
mind.
Because
other
company
cars
with
all
the
features
which
I
have
in
my
car
will
cost
me
more
than
8
laks.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox
Engine
is
top
notch.
No
complaints
whatsoever.
 Now
after
almost
22
months
it
gives
18-19
with
AC
on
all
the
time.
Gear
box
is
a
problem
sometimes

shift
is
not
smooth.
I
think
in
the
new
one
introduced
in
2013
they
have
improved.
 So
far
problem
I
faced
is
with
alternator

it
went
out
of
service
after
16
months.
I
think
it
is
because
I
am
continously
using
it

daily
at
least
I
start
and
stop
10-12
times.
 It
cost
me
12
000.
If
I
had
taken
extended
warranty

I
would
have
saved
that
money
as
it
was
free
replacement.
But
I
had
not
taken
extended
warranty.
I
recommend
anyone
buying
any
car
to
please
take
extended
warranty.
I
made
a
mistake
by
saving
3000
on
extended
warranty
and
ended
up
paying
12
000.
The
silencer
is
becoming
loose

I
have
to
check
it.
Otherwise
no
problems.
 In
22
months
I
have
driven
about
34
000
km.
So
value
for
money.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
Smooth

I
drive
most
of
the
times
on
very
bad
roads

but
it
handles
it
well.
 My
friend
has
Toyota
Etios
also

and
he
also
drives
as
much
as
I
do

but
he
has
faced
more
problems.
So
my
conclusion
is
my
Indigo
is
better.
Etios
is
good
for
smooth
roads
not
for
bad.
 Service
is
excellent
in
Thrissur

Kerala.
No
complaints
at
all.
By
the
way
service
for
all
model
cars
in
Kerala
they
have
very
good
service.
So
everyone
is
equal
there.
Final
Words
Really
value
for
money.
Areas
of
improvement
Panel
gaps

they
look
awful.
And
plastic.
But
I
know
Tata
will
not
improve

they
are
like
government.

I
took
a
test
drive
of
Mahindra
Verito
D4
in
Mumbai
on
30th
May
2011.
Here
are
my
comments:
 
Exterior
It’s
all
Mahindra
now
and
they
have
removed
Renault
name
and
logo
from
the
car.
It
gets
Mahindra
logo
in
the
front

rear
and
on
the
center
of
steering
wheel.
Rear
spoiler
and
appliqué
looks
posh
and
gives
an
image
to
the
car.
Body
side
mounting
&
cladding
and
roof
rails
gives
enhanced
looks
though
I
feel
that
they
are
not
required.
 
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

No
car
in
this
category
can
beat
the
space Verito
has.
It
had
got
ample
headroom

legroom
and
shoulder
space
in
the
front
and
rear.
Driving
in
Mumbai
city
traffic
was
really
easy
because
of
lots
of
driving
leg
space.
Three
adults
can
sit
comfortably
in
the
rear
seat
and
they
have
one
headrest
for
each
of
them
which should help
to
make
long
journeys
more
relaxed.
Power
window
controls
for
front
windows
are on
the
centre
console
and
for
rear
windows
are
in
middle

behind
the hand
brake

but
they
are
easily
accessible
to
operate.
A/C is
powerful
enough
and
the
passengers
at
rear
felt
the
cold
air
even
at
2.
It
has
boot
opener
and
fuel
lid
opener
in
the
cabin
but
bonnet
opener
is
on
the
front
passenger
side

it’s
odd
but
it
won't
be
used
that
frequently
hence
it’s
ok.
Dash
board
is
simple
but
informative.
It
has
analogue
tachometer
but
fuel
and
engine
temperature
indicators
are
digital
on
the
LCD
display.
It
also
has
on-board
computer
which
displays
Average
fuel
consumption

Average
speed
and
Distance
to
empty.
This
is
very
useful
for
they
who
do
frequent
long
journeys.
There
was
no
music
system
in
the
test
drive
vehicle.

We
drove
in
Mumbai
city

for
around
an
hour with
A/C
on
but
the
fuel
tank
mark
on
the
dashboard
was
showing
empty!!!
The
dealer
told
that
it
has
got
around
8
liters
of
reserve
and
can
go
for
another
100kms
without
refueling.
I
found
the
gear
shifting
very
smooth.
Clutch

brake
and
acceleration
pedals
were a
bit
hard
but
I
guess
they'll
soften once
used
regularly.

&

I
felt
the
power
steering
was
hard
but
the
dealer
informed
me
its
because
the
car
is
new
and
PDI
is
not
done.
It
will
improve
after
that.
Otherwise
the
ride
quality
was
really
good

didn't
feel
and
jerks
while
driving.
Braking
in
traffic was
very
controlled.
 
Final
Words
Its
spacious

runs
well

suspensions
are
good.
Overall
it
was
a
comfortable
ride
in
Mumbai
traffic.
It’s
a
good
attempt
by
Mahindra
to
get
rid
of
Logan's
taxi
image.
Mahindra
will
have
to
provide
excellent
after
sales
service
if
they
want
to
make
this
car
successful
and
not
another
taxi.

The
Verito
retains
the
Logan’s
trapezoidal
headlights.
The
front
end
though

gets
restyled
fog
lights
which
give
the
bumper
a
more
pronounced
look.
The
front
grille
has
been
slightly
redesigned
to
hoist
the
Mahindra
logo
and
thankfully

doesn’t
bring
in
the
‘bunny-tooth’
treatment
from
the
Mahindra
SUVs.
The
addition
of
chrome
garnished
roof
rails
adds
a
hint
of
sportiness
to
the
Verito
but
doesn’t
hamper
the
car’s
wide-body
image.
Get
inside
the
car

familiarise
yourself
with
the
buttons
and
the
layout
and
you
immediately
see
the
shortcomings
of
the
cost
cutting
involved.
No

I’m
not
talking
about
low-rent
plastics
or
materials
–
in
fact
the
materials
used
are
quite
satisfactory
for
a
car
of
this
category.
Yes

these
are
quite
a
few
shortcomings
but
are
easy
to
forget
once
you
start
appreciating
the
Verito’s
comfort
level
–
at
the
front
and
at
the
back.
The
seats
are
wide

cushy

come
with
adjustable
seatbelts
and
are
ergonomically
designed
as
compared
to
the
switches
and
levers
in
the
car.
The
Verito’s
back
seat
gets
three
headrests

therefore
underscoring
the
fact
that
this
rear
bench
is
meant
to
seat
three
adults
in
comfort.
The
high
roofline
provides
ample
headroom
for
all
passengers
and
imparts
roominess
to
the
cabin.
The
farthest
I
drove
without
a
break
was
about
220
kms
and
none
one
of
us
in
the
Verito
had
any
complaints
about
head/back/butt
ache
or
motion
sickness.Mahindra-VeritoThe
air
conditioning
in
the
Verito
is
top
notch.
Even
in
the
hottest
temperatures
the
air-con
still
managed
to
cool
the
cabin
in
jiffy
even
on
a
hot
Hyderabad
afternoon.
The
Verito
also
has
a
pair
of
redesigned
outside
rear
view
mirrors

ORVMs

which
are
now
bigger
in
size
than
the
Logan’s.
No
electronic
operation
for
these
though

even
on
the
top
end
model.
The
windows
however
get
the
electronic
treatment
but
the
switches
are
awkwardly
placed
and
the
auto-down/up
function
for
the
driver
window
is
sorely
missed.
The
Verito
places
a
digital
multi-information
display
in
the
instrumentation
console
which
has
read
outs
for
the
odometer

trip
meter

range
calculator

real
time
fuel
economy

temperature
gauge
and
the
fuel
gauge.
The
Verito
continues
to
use
the
Renault
petrol
and
diesel
engines.
The
1.5-litre
dCi
diesel
engine
produces
65PS
of
power
at
4
000
RPM
and
160Nm
of
torque
at
2
000
RPM.
Start
the
engine
and
it
settles
into
a
muted
burble
which
is
on
par
with
other
diesel
vehicles
in
its
class
like
the
Maruti
Suzuki
Swift
DZire
and
Tata
Indigo.
At
idling
RPM

there
is
no
handshaking
vibration
in
the
gearstick
whatsoever.
The
clutch
feels
a
tad
heavy
as
compared
to
its
competition
and
needs
getting
used
to.
I
particularly
do
not
like
the
way
the
Verito
gets
moving
in
first
gear
as
the
test
mule
felt
very
sluggish
off
the
line.
But
once
in
second
gear
and
past
the
2
000
RPM
mark

the
160
Nm
of
torque
makes
driving
this
car
a
breeze.Mahindra-VeritoThe
Verito’s
suspension
is
a
big
surprise.
Around
the
bends
the
Verito
holds
its
composure
like
none
other
in
its
segment
–
bettered
only
by
the
Ford
Fiesta
Classic.
The
Vertio
comes
with
McPherson-type
suspension
upfront
with
a
wishbone
link.
This
setup
gobbles
broken
roads
and
pot
holes
without
a
thud
like
an
automatic
vacuum
cleaner
that
runs
around
the
house
gobbling
every
ounce
of
dirt
lying
on
the
floor
without
breaking
a
sweat.
The
steering
feels
well
weighted
around
corners
and
on
the
straights
but
feels
a
tad
too
heavy
for
city
use.
It
should
make
your
forearms
stronger

nevertheless.Verdict:Right
from
the
beginning
of
this
review

my
tone
must
have
got
you
to
believe
that
I
absolutely
hate
the
Verito
/
Logan.
But
trust
me

I’m
far
from
it.
As
an
automotive
journalist

it
is
my
duty
to
point
out
all
the
shortcomings
of
the
vehicle

but
as
a
true
auto
buff

it
is
next
to
impossible
for
me
to
hate
the
Verito
after
driving
it
for
over
400
kms
in
three
days.
Yes

it
does
have
those
little
niggles
that
Mahindra
should
have
addressed
during
the
transition.
But
these
niggles
are
too
small
to
ruin
your
experience
in
the
Verito.
It
looks
and
feels
very
basic

but
the
engineering
it
top
notch.
Everything
is
so
well
put
together
that
it
just
works
like
a
charm.
The
car
is
comfortable
in
the
city
and
on
the
highway.
The
engine
is
peppy
and
frugal.
The
suspension
lets
you
push
the
car
to
its
limits
without
any
unnerving
body
roll
and
still
manages
to
take
care
of
the
pot
holes
and
broken
roads
without
breaking
your
back.
And
this
is
why
it
is
a
hot
favourite
amongst
fleet
operators
too
–
for
the
engineering
just
doesn’t
fall
apart.Mahindra-VeritoThat
brings
us
back
to
two
things
–
the
price
and
the
understated
look.
At
Rs.
6.62-lakh

ex-showroom

for
the
top
end
diesel
variant

the
Verito
is
one
of
the
cheapest
diesel
sedans
as
compared
to
its
competitors.
It
completely
warrants
the
price
with
its
no-nonsense
approach
gives
the
entry
level
sedan
buyers
everything
that
they
are
looking
for.
Yes

the
looks
are
understated
and
old
school.
But
look
at
it
this
way

after
a
very
extensive
market
research
in
India
and
after
taking
inputs
from
zillions
of
people

Toyota
came
up
the
highly
successful
Etios
sedan
which
looks
so
much
like
the
Verito
/
Logan.
Do
we
still
need
more
reasons
to
believe
that
understated
and
elegant
designs
coupled
with
the
bare
essentials
are
still
in
demand
in
India
as
compared
to
radical
or
overtly
curvy

feature
rich
cars?
I
think
not...
VERITO
TRIVIA:Also
a
few
things
about
this
car
which
normally
are
not
mentioned
anywhere
as
they
are
not
known
to
people.To
start
with
Renault-Logan

A.K.A
VERITO

is
expensive
because
most
of
the
body
parts
are
still
imported
from
Romania...

This
car
is
basically
designed
for
European
countries
like
Romania

Slovakia

Serbia
etc
and
its
a
budget
sedan
with
good
safety
features.
You
will
be
surprised
to
know
that
the
suspension
of
this
car
is
that
of
Renault-Clios
which
is
going
to
be
soon
made
in
India.
Infact
most
of
the
parts
are
being
shared
from
Renault-Clio
and
that's
how
they
were
able
to
keep
down
the
costs.
The
Verito

Renault
Logan

is
the
only
other
car
apart
from
Volkswagen
Vento
which
offers
5
years
of
Anti-corrosion
body.
Verito's

Renault
Logan

body
is
made
with
18mm
steel
which
makes
the
car
very
heavy
and
strong.
Also
the
car
has
amazing
Off-Road
capabilities
due
to
excellent
ground
clearence
of
172mm
and
due
to
very
less
body
moving
parts
there
is
absolutely
no
rattles
even
after
3
lakh
kms.This
car
is
very
cheap
to
maintain
and
the
maintenance
cost
for
every
10000
kms
is
not
more
than
rs.3200/-
.
This
car
features
a
Variometric
A/C
which
chills
the
car
in
no
time.
The
tyres
are
also
nice
and
thicker
compared
to
other
cars
in
this
segment.
Last
but
not
the
least
this
car
poses
a
very
big
Boot
of
510liters
and
it
has
one
of
the
best
N-Cap
ratings
in

Exterior
 Verito
has
good
looks
from
outside.
This
is
my
personal
assessment.
Many
people
find
the
car
still
like
Logan

box
shape
etc.
.
Yet
I
feel
that
Verito

with
small
modifications

has
an
improved
look.
It
seems
to
be
a
seasoned
person's
car

not
for
young
people.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

 Cabin
space
is
good.
The
car
is
wider
than
even
the
Manza.
Three
persons
can
sit
comfortably
in
the
back
with
ample
leg
room.
Front
seats
are
also
quite
wide
and
comfortable
for
long
drives.
There
are
some
controls
which
are
placed
at
odd
places

but
I
feel
that
one
gets
used
to
them
very
soon.
The
indicators
are
placed
on
the
left
and
it
may
take
time
to
get
used
to
them.
Quality
of
plastic

fabric
etc.
is
good
keeping
in
view
the
price
of
the
car.
One
can
not
expect
top
end
material
in
a
car
of
this
price
range.
Yet
interior
is
pragmatic
and
should
be
OK
with
most
of
the
 buyers.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox
 The
best
part
of
the
car
is
its
engine
and
the
power
that
it
emits.
Even
though
the
diesel
engine
produces
less
power
than
manza

yet
there
was
no
lag
in
acceleraion
and
torque.
In
hills

torque
is
more
important
than
power
and
Verito
does
the
job
appreciably.
The
gears
are
smooth.
The
brake
padel
is
a
bit
hard

wooden
feel
it
gives
.
But
the
engineer
told
me
that
it
will
become
somewhat
soft
after
some
use.
Fuel
economy
is
very
good.
Mahindra
cars
have
lived
up
to
their
claims.
Though
I
could
not
test
the
car
for
long
duration

but
what
other
users
have
told
me
the
fuel
efficiency
is
more
than
expected.
I
will
get
my
car
in
a
few
days
and
I
am
going
on
a
very
long
trip
the
same
day
testing
the
car
in
all
sort
of
conditions.
After
that
I
will
again
write
this
review.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
 Handling
of
car
is
exceptionally
good.
Ride
quality
is
fine
and
one
feels
comfortable.
The
steering
is
smooth
and
respsnsive.
First
time
buyers
should
be
careful
with
steering
as
it
is
very
responsive.
I
did
not
get
the
feeling
that
I
was
driving
a
bigger
car.
Final
Words
 What
I
feel
from
the
test
drive

this
car
takes
the
cake.
At
this
price
point

one
can
not
expect
feature
of
very
high
end
cars.
But
this
car
has
all
those
features
which
are
needed
by
a
common
user.
Go
for
this
car
without
a
second
thought.
I
said
elsewhere
that
as
a
good
looking
girl
may
not
be
a
good
wife

so
a
very
good
looking
car
may
not
be
the
best
option.
Areas
of
improvement
 Boot
lid
needs
some
more
improvement.
Audio
system
is
needed
in
almost
all
the
varients.

Exterior
For
a
person
like
me
exterior
really
does
not
matter
with
respect
to
this
car
because
this
car
is
intended
for
people
who
really
need
the
car
for
usage
rather
than
to
flash
off
if
one
goes
through
the
design
it
is
straight
where
in
case
of
any
accident
there
would
be
less
cost
in
fixing
it
Thecar
was
designed
so
that
it
was
affordable
to
the
average
european
people.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

For
a
budget
car
the
interiors
are
reasonable
in
many
reviews
I
have
gone
through
I
have
noticed
that
people
have
complained
about
odd
power
window
switches.
My
personal
observation
is
that
since
the
car
is
a
budget
car
the
idea
is
that
the
power
window
swithches
are
to
be
operated
by
driver
and
all
the
passengers
in
this
case
the
driver
can
operate
all
the
switches
and
the
passengers
can
also
operate
individually
the
designetrs
of
this
car
have
eleminated
the
excess
wiring
that
would
run
to
individual
switches
thereby
reducing
the
failure
and
consequently
the
maintanence
and
i
personally
think
that
how
many
times
do
I
have
to
open
the
windows
during
the
travel
and
if
i
have
to
i
can
with
small
adjustments.
i
am
personally
happy
that
the
indian
manufacturers
have
not
fiddeled
with
the
europen
designes
if
i
go
for
this
vehicle
then
i
am
guranted
a
proven
europen
pacakage
so
i
dont
really
worried
about
the
left
hand
drive
interiors.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox
Before
I
went
out
to
purchase
this
car
i
had
gone
through
the
reviews
of
many
cars
and
had
also
taken
the
test
rides
I
had
gone
through
the
specification
of
fiat
engines
toyota
engines
and
renault
engines
toyota
engine
is
1.4
68/170
fiat
engine
is
1.3
70/190
renault
engine
is
66/160
my
personal
interpretation
is
that
a
bigger
size
engine
is
giving
less
power
and
smaller
size
engine
is
giving
more
power
i
equate
this
to
a
stronger
man
is
made
to
do
less
work
and
a
bit
weaker
man
made
to
do
more
work
so
eventually
in
long
run
a
weaker
man
is
going
get
exhausted
much
earlier
than
the
stronger
man
like
wise
eventually
toyota
and
renault
would
be
less
maintance
giving
vehicles.

Final
Words
I
have
decided
to
go
for
this
car
after
reading
all
the
reviews
and
consulting
100's
of
drivers
including
TAXI
fellows
who
have
been
driving
this
car
since
the
launch
of
LOGAN.
Areas

Interiors

Look

The
side

are
better
then
the

previous
which
adds
to
its
looks
and
also
the

which
perfectly

fits
with
the
car.
The

no

Please
note

a
person
purchasing
a
full
option
vehicle

he
is
expecting
a
company
fitted
full
loaded
vehicle.
In
Verito
D6

i
am
shocked
by
seeing
ordinary
spare
wheel
in
dickey.
If
i
noticed
it
before
delivery

i
may
re
think
in
purchase
Verito.
For
an
amount
of
3000-4000

why
mahindra
do
this
type
of
cheap
adjustments.
The
spare
wheel
may
be
used
at
any
time.
Imagine
a
vehicle
running
in
3
alloy
wheel
and
one
ordinary
wheel
in
city.
It
is
like
a
man
walking
with
shoe
in
one
leg
and
chapel
in
another.
So
it
is
very
bad
that
u
give
a
D6
owner
only
4
alloy
wheel
only.
I
don't
know
is
there
any
other
adjustments
maid
by
Mahindra
in
any
other
places
too.
We
love
Mahindra
because
Mahindra
in
an
Indian
Brand

we
expect
a
lot
of
from
u.
Don't
spoil
it
by
doing
 cheap
adjustments.

Exterior
Though
its
not
one
of
the
best
things
to
look
at
on
the
road

but
the
design
keeps
it
very
stable.
The
driver
visibility
is
very
good
and
it
keeps
the
car
stable
at
very
high
speeds.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

Space
is
unmatched

We
are
a
family
of
very
well
built
people
and
all
5
of
us
can
sit
in
the
car
comfortably.
However

the
interior
plastic
quality
is
a
little
inferior

the
door
opening
and
closing
handles
inside
seem
to
be
just
put
there
without
any
thought.
They
do
make
a
little
noise
when
you
are
trying
to
open/close
the
door.
If
you
keep
the
car
in
the
sun
for
a
long
time
it
smells
of
burning
plastic.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox
This
is
the
killer

I
bought
the
verito
because
of
its
amazing
fuel
efficiency.
I
clock
20.4kmpl
 in
a
city
like
bangalore
with
AC
on
at
all
times.
At
highways
i
have
got
25.9
kmpl

I
also
have
a
photograph
to
prove
it.
That
makes
the
efficiency
better
than
what
Honda
Amaze
currently
advertises.
There
is
no
turbo
lag
and
at
lower
gears
there
is
enough
power
to
go
up
a
steep
hill
with
5
people
inside.
The
gearbox
also
was
easy
to
use
even
for
my
wife
who
was
using
an
I10
earlier. 
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
The
Ride
quality
is
great
because
of
the
strong
suspension
and
i
have
noticed
that
if
you
have
more
people
in
the
car
the
better
it
drives.
The
fastest
that
i
drove
the
car
was
about
145
Kmph
and
it
was
very
stable
and
handled
curves
very
well.
Final
Words
I
am
in
Sales
and
Verito
comes
as
a
welcome
gift

the
fuel
efficiency
and
the
space
at
this
price
is
unimaginable.
I
have
made
my
choice
and
have
driven
for
around
11k
kms
in
about
the
4
months
since
I
bought
the
car
and
am
really
happy
to
have
made
the
decision.
Areas
of
improvement
The
only
area
of
improvement
is
the
interior
plastic
quality
and
the
hard
steering.
Apart
from
that
the
car
has
got
most
of
the
things
right.

Hi

its
Kalidass
from
Chennai

Proud
to
own
a
Verito
D4.
I
have
taken
the
verito
three
weeks
before.
It
gave
me
20.4
KM/L
for
the
first
filling
and
22.8
in
the
second
filling.
My
average
drive
is
around
100-110
Km
per
day.
Maintained
1500-1700
RPM
for
the
running
in
period
and
even
in
this
rpm
the
speedometer
clocked
100
some
times.
Driving
control
is
good.
The
console
in
the
interior
is
not
up
to
the
standard
and
is
not
user
friendly.
Reaching
and
adjusting
the
AC
controls

is
very
difficult.
Good

wiper
probably
designed
for
the
Left
hand
drive
vehicle
and
is
not
suitable
for
the
right
hand

Needs
more
improvement
to
tackle
the

to
turn
your
entire
body
and
head
for
a
right
turn
in
rain.
The
ugly
finish
of
the
body
over
the
tyres
spoils
the
look
of
the
vehicle

even
you
see
the

the
projection
over
the

blocking
some

The
engine
noise
being
felt
inside
the
cabin
is
due
to
the
poor
interior
fixing/design
or
packing
the
gaps.
The
Engine
is
absolutely
fine
and
smooth
and
for
times
while
cursing

you
may
feel
that
you
are

still

they

it's
got
a
well
planted
look
as
far
as
the
front
end
is
concerned.
The
profile
of
the
car
is
very
balanced
and
the
boot
is
neatly
integrate

the
diamond
cut
15"
alloys
add
to
the
profile
look
and
fill
the
wheel
wells
adequetly.
The
rear
of
the
car
is
bland
and
narrow.
Very
simple
and
plain
but
we'll
suite
to
the
car

maybe
something
more
tdone
to
the
rear
styling
would
have
looked
overdone

nevertheless
it's
acceptable.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

This
is
the
place
which
sold
the
car
to
me


the
design


fit
and
finish
and
features
are
top
notch
and
would
not
feel
out
of
place
in
a
car
which
is
a
segment
higher.
The
controls
on
the
steering
wheel
are
very
intuitive
to
use
and
all
controls
are
appropriately
placed.the
stereo
connects
easily
with
the
phone
and
sound
quality
is
quite
acceptable.
One
thing
which
requires
special
mention
is
the
gear
knob

it's
got
a
very
good
finish
and
is
of
a
very
high
quality.
The
only
grouce
I
have
with
car's
interior
is
that
the
front
seats
could
do
with
more
coushioning
and
the
car
does
not
lock
automatically.
The
ac
of
the
car
is
very
good
and
makes
the
cabin
a
very
comfortable
Place
to
be
in. 
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox
The
engine
of
the
car

diesel

is
very
responsive
in
the
city
and
there
is
minimal
turbo
lag

the
low
end
and
mid
range
is
the
forte
of
the
engine
and
city
driving
is
very
comfortable
with
its
linear
power
delivery

the
top
end
is
where
the
car
looses
its
breath
and
its
advisable
to
keep
the
engine
in
the
mid
range
to
use
it
effortlessly.
I've
driven
the
car
on
highways
as
we'll
and
the
car
can
cruise
easily
at
speeds
of
120
to
130


above
which
you
need
the
work
a
little
harder
with
gearbox
and
engine.
The
gearbox
is
very
smooth
and
a
joy
to
use.
The
engine
noise
in
the
cabin
is
minimal
as
compared
to
other
diesel
engined
cars.
I
got
around
17-18
kmpl
on
the
highway


May
be
due
to
the
spirited
driving

and
around
13
in
city.
In
extreme
traffic
conditions
it
gives
around
11.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
The
ride
quality
of
the
car
is
not
very
absorbent
and
bad
patches
of
road
do
filter
in

the
suspension
is
a
bit
on
the
stiffer
side

otherwise
its
pretty
comfortable.
The
handling
of
the
car
is
very
good
in
the
city
and
the
car
is
very
easy
to
use
in
the
congested
roAds
of
the
city

on
the
highway
the
ride
quality
a
more
than
acceptable.
Final
Words
The
built
of
the
car
is
very
good
and
you
get
pampered
the
features
on
offer

go
for
the
top
end
models
as
they
are
fully
loaded
and
make
the
car
an
interesting
place
to
spend
time
in.
If
city
driving
is
what
you
do
mainly
then
you
cannot
get
a
better
deal
at
this
price.
Areas
of
improvement
The
brakes
need
to
have
more
bite
and
more
colour
options
should
be
available.

Being
the
addition
on
Grandi10
the

are

From
Back

Hyundai
has
really
invested
good.
Interior

Features

Space

Lot
many
features
which
you
can
find
in
the
top
model
of
Grand
i10
but
not
in
any
other
car
of
the
same
compact
sedan
segment.
You
will
not

Engine
is
optimal
for
the
power
&
fuel
economy
and
Gearbox
is
easy
to
handle.
Hyundai
has
taken
out
the
max
power
from
engine
and
to
give
max
fuel
economy
as
what
else
can
you
expect
more
from
the
1.1
capacity.
I
took
the
test
drive
of
the
diesel
car
and
found
a
bit
less
powered
as
compared
to
the
Grand
i10
diesel.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
You
may
feel
the
suspensions
not

great
but
the
handling
is
relaxing
on
city
roads.
Final
Words
A
superior
car
than
Amaze
and
Dzire.
Good
to
go
and
book
it

since
people
already
know
the
performance
of
Grand

In
my

reason
it
is
not
advisable
to
 go

100km

whatever

The

is
good

drive
in
the

It
has
a
smooth

comfortable

As
it

low

one
can
just
feel
a

of
lag

have
been
checking

gives
me
around
18

was

either
to
buy

VDI

LS
Disel


as
i
have
been
a
Maruti
user
since
ages.
But
after
using
it
for
3
months
and
driving
it
for
4000Kms
i
feel
that
i
should
buy
another
SAIL
as
said
i
use
them
as
Cabs
to
ferry
passengers
and
this
is
the
perfect
car
that
caters
my
needs.

But
once

It
is
really
space
for

accepetable

Very

Final
Words
I
have
already
given
booking
for
Amaze.
Expecting
ASAP
and
have
some
change.
My
review
is
not
biased
at
all
for
liking
honda
over
desrie
or
swift.
I
have
been
enjoying
swift
LDI
for
5
years.
It
is
just
a
new
car
in
portfolio.
for
city
drive. 
Areas
of
improvement
I
have
taken
very
short
test
drive
and
observed
a
 little
diesel
engine
noise

in
side
cabin.
But
I
feel
it
is
okay
for
me
specially
u
are
driving
with
music
system
on
and
enjoying
cornering
and
extra
power
u
are
getting
from
1500
cc.
If
honda
can
work
on
making
extra
silent
cabin.
That
would
definately
screw
rest
of
the
maket
in
this
sagment
for
sure.
No
doubt
at
all.

Full
Review

I
have
bought
Amaze
Dsl
and
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
driving
feel
and
quality
of
the
product.
I
have
an
experience
of
working
with
Automobile
companies
like
Fiat

Mahindra

Hyundai
and
driven
and
experienced
a
lot
of
cars
from
the
same.
I
have
faced
the
below
issues
by
now
and
this
makes
the
drive
feel
quite
bad.
1.
shaking:
The
car
shakes
a
lot
during
slow
speeds
and
great
shifts.
2.
Top
Speed:
No
matter
the
care
is
a
1.5ltr
engine
but
it
does
not
allow
the
car
to
exceed
a
top
speed
of
145kmph
which
was
clearly
known
during
our
trial
run.
3.
Humming
Frt
Wheels
:
There
is
huge
humming
sounds
which
is
quite
disturbing

this
might
be
due
to
the
incorrect
Tyre
size
or
the
hardness
of
the
Tyre.
4.
RPM
Fluctuations:
At
times
when
we
shift
the
gear
to
3rd
gear
the
speed
raves
up
to
40kmph
and
goes
on
increasing
and
at
time
the
speed
is
normal
between
20kmph
to
30kmph.
5.
Engine
Vibrations
:
During
acceleration
it
is
found
that
the
car
shakes
alot
and
there
is
a
lot
a
vibration
which
can
be
felt
inside
the
car
compartment
on
the
seats
while
driving.
6.Fuel
Efficiency:
It
is
quite
poor
against
the
claim
made
by
Honda

I
get
a
fuel
efficiency
of
16kmpl
at
the
max.
It
is
a
diff
of
about
40%
against
the
claim
made
by
Honda.
I
had
always
expected
it
to
be
around
20kmpl.
7.RR
Wheel
Arch
PVC
covers
are
also
missing
creates
the
car
alot
messy
and
dirty
in
rainy
season.
I
think
there
are
lot
teething
issues
which
honda
should
consider.

If
you
want
to
deliver
a
product
to
a
customer

dont
make
a
demand.
First
of
all
you
people
get
all
approvals
from
RTO

Goverments

to
make
customer
service
at
better
level.
I
own
Honda
City
and
when
we
bought
before
7
Years
earlier

their
response
towards
customers
were
quite
good.
But
now

as
if
we
are
all
beggers
waiting
for
free
products
from
Honda.
We
are
paying
money
for
the
product
we
buy
from
our
pocket
&
not
from
your
pocket.
So
learn
your
mistakes!!!
or
you
will
be
out
of
the
market
soon.!!!

Final
Words
Honda

are
not
able
to
match
delivery
promises.
When
booking

they
said
delivery
will
begin
in
April
2013.
Now
they
say
wait
till
May
end.
Poor
Show.
Personally
I
feel

competititers
should
throw
in
some
promotions
to
cash
on
over
this
situation
of
Over
Promise-Under

Areas
of

Climate

Increase

a
must.
Protect
the
A/C

from
stray
stones.

be
free

move
in
case
of

from
passing

synchronizing
the

as
mentioned

you
will
feel
the

Focus
a

you
may

once
you
get
the

you
will
automatically
   
reduce

will
automatically
roll
in

and
eco
lite
will
be
constantly
be
on.
   
In
this
way
your
gear
shifting
will
reduce.
When
you
shift
to
1st
gear
you
can
pull
your
car
to
1500
RPM.
At
1500
RPM

shift
to
2nd
gear

then
on
every 2000
RPM
change

so
you
don't
strain
the

Only
in

you
pull
it

I
am
here
with
a
really
bad
experience
with
HONDA.
My
trust
within
this
brand
shattered
when
my
newly
purchased

only
2
months
back

HONDA
AMAZE
stopped
only
in
1
-
1.5
ft
water.
When
I
bought
this
car

I
was
communicated
that
I
should
not
opt
self
start
this
vehicle.
I
followed
the
same
and
I
even
did
not
try
to
start
the
engine.

other

Alto

Wagon
R
Swift

figo

Maruti

Tata

&
even

were
moving
smoothly

it
was
only
Honda
which
stopped.
It
was
not
only
my
Honda

but
other
Honda
cars
also
stopped!
When
I
was
planning
to
buy
a
car

all
has
all
options

but
still

I
chose
Honda
as
it
is
a
world
renowned
brand.
But
all
in
vein

I
am
really
disappointed
and
my
review
for
HONDA
brand
is
that
they
are
not
trustworthy
at
all.

Me
to

Very

Hydrolock 
a
shorthand
notation
for hydrostatic
lock

is
an
abnormal
condition
of
any
device
which
is
designed
to
compress
a
gas
by
mechanically
restraining
it;
most
commonly
the
reciprocating
internal
combustion
engine

the
case
this
article
refers
to
unless
otherwise
noted.
Hydrolock
occurs
when
a
volume
of
liquid
greater
than
the
volume
of
the
cylinder
at
its
minimum

end
of
the
piston's
stroke

enters
the
cylinder.
Since
most
common
liquids
are
incompressible
the
piston
cannot
complete
its
travel;
either
the
engine
must
stop
rotating
or
a
mechanical
failure
must
occur.

I

been

for
around
12
years

owns
this

for
21
months
now
but
ony
drove
around
180
days
30000
KMS
. 
Love
to
go
for
long
journeys
but
Amaze
is
not
the
vehicle
for
it

very
stiff
suspension

neck
support
is
very
important
when
we
driving
longer
streches

plastics
already
making
noises
from
different
places

metal
and
the
overall
insulation
is
two
thin

when
driving
through
rain
feels
like
you
are
under
a
tin
roof

with
out
music
on

noise
is
unbearable
 Areas

Better

something
better
to
avaoid

better

for
to

neck

on
any
other
sporty

learn

This
car
is
designed
for
people
of
Thaiiland
or
Japan.
and
not
for
Indians.
The
front
grill
has
a
very
little
HORN
which
is
smaller
than
your
Activa
Scooter.
Can
you
imagine
using
it
on
Indian
Raods?
The
front
grill
need
redesigning.
It
has
very
large
vents
which
allow
any
hard
object
to
enter
into
the
grill
damaging
Radiater.
This
car
need
a
plastic
Jali/
Fret
Panel
to
use
to
protect
the
radiater.
Interior
:
needs
lots
of
redesigning.
I
had
to
fix
many
things
myself
to
make
easy
use.
I
can
write
100s
of
bad
things
in
Interior.
 Please
do
not
buy
anything
that
you
need
to
hang
in
the
car.
There
is
no
option.
Also
do
not
carry
your
coat
with
you
in
the
car
for
marriage
or
other
party.
There
is
nothing
to
hang.
Throw
it
on
the
seat
but
never
put
anything
behind
the
back
seat.
It
will
come
on
your
head
if
break
the
car
suddenly.
Engine
Performance
is
OK
but
my
car
failed
one
day
and
pulled
on
a
truck.
This

is
very
bad.
I
will
not

Hi
Everyone

This
is
the
review
i'm
giving
to
all
customer
who
are
planning
to
buy
Honda
vehicles.
My
experience
was
with
Sundaram
Honda

Secunderabad.
My
vehicle
number:
TS10BXXXXXX.
I
was
bought
a
new
band
new
Amaze
1.5
S
Diesel
version.
With
them
on
1st

OCT-2014
and
found
some
problems.
We
have
a
compliant
filed
on
06th-October

2014
and
the
complaint
number
is
"1-2101-XXXXXX"

we
did
n't
get
any
response
from
the
honda
till
20th-Oct
2014.
The
issue
observed
in
the
brand
new
vehicle
are:1.side
pulling2.Engine
Sound3.Dashboard
Vibration
The
honda
service
people
have
taken
the
vehicle
on
20th-Oct

2014
and
the
KM
reading
was
"699KM".
After
that
on
22nd-Oct
2014
the
vehicle
was
checked
by
SetuRaman
&
Srinivas
and
told
that
everything
is
fine
and
asked
me
to
take
the
vehicle.The
KM
meter
reading
was
"928KM".But
after
checking
I
found
the
issues
still
persist
and
not
at
all
solved.I'm
not
sure
why
company
as
drove
it
for
"229
KM".After
continuos
calls
to
showroom
and
service
people

they
have
taken
vehicle
again
to
the
service
center
on
3rd-Nov
2014
the
KM
reading
was
"1007"
and
delivered
to
ussaying
that
issues
are
solved
on
6th-Nov
2014
the
KM
reading
was
"1258KM".I'm
not
sure
why
company
as
drove
it
for
"251
KM".
And
kept
the
vehicle
3
days.
The
problem
is
still
not
solved.The
important
Note
is
that
Sundaram
Honda
employee
SRINIVAS
S
SalesManager
has
closed
our
compliant
"1-2101-XXXXXX"
though
he
already
knew
that
the
problem
is
not
solved.
I'm
still
have
all
issues
in
papers
while
registration.
Ultimate
information
is
when
we
mailed
Honda
customer
service
representatives
Parampreet
Gopinath

about
showroom
people
behaviour
they
asked
us
to
contact
showroom
people
again
..:
:

Final
Words I'm
already
in
soup
so
wanted
to
share
my
experience
which
might
help
new
friends
who
are
planning
to
buy
Honda
vehicles
that
to
at
Sundaram
Showrooms

Secunderabad.
Areas
of
improvement
Best
to
go
for
some
other
vehicle
where
there
is
respect
for
customers
and
better
service.

Hi
All

I
bought
Honda
amaze
diesel
in
december'13
and
got
to
know
that
there
was
engine
and
diesel
oil
leakage
first
500
km.
They
repaired
most
of
the
engine
but
refused
to
replace
their
own
manufactured
defective
car.
They
REPAIRED
head
gas
kit

re-fixed
timing
plates..
All
the
cylinders..
Replaced
the
o
ring
and
god
knows
what
more
they
have
done
to
my
car.
All
this
was
done
without
my
consent 
Now
my
car
has
multiple
issues
and
Honda
doesn't
even
bother
to
respond
back
my
mails.
Now.
there
are
following
issues
in
the
car
1.Noise

to
contact
the
company
but
not

All
I
can
say
is
Honda
is
just
fancy
brand..
Maruti
is
far
better.

My
Honda
Amaze
Diesel
has
done
about
6500
kms.
The
mileage
has
dropped
drastically
from
19-20
to
15-16

on
the
same
pattern
of
usage.
Car
has
a
lot
of
cabin
noise

which
other
diesel
cars
don't
have.
Also

the
suspension
is
ill
designed

under
capacity
suspension
for
a
diesel
car.
My
4
year
old
accent
sails
smoothly
over
potholes

while
the
new
amaze
fails
to
absorb
any
of
the
bumps
and
rattles
too.
Am
not
very
happy

but
since
I
just
bought
the
car

I
guess
i'll
have
to
live
with
it.
Please
do
check
other
cars
like
ford
ecosport


even
if
you
have
a
waiting
period

which
are
priced
in
the
same
bracket.
They're
packed
with
features

which
even
the
Honda
Amaze
top
model
does
not
have

and
they
don't
have
such
problems
like
Amaze.
Its
worth
the
wait.
Happy
Driving.

I
have
had
this
car
for
about
a
month.
Airconditioning
is
excellent
even
at
the
height
of
Delhi
summer.
The
quality
of
plastics
is
not
as
good
as
the
City.The
stereo
does
not
accept
new
USB
pen
drives
of
reputed
companies
like
HP.
It
only
accepts
older
pen
drives
of
Kingston
etc.
It
seems
to
be
a
software
problem
which
the
dealer
has
not
been
able
to
fix.
I
would
like
to
hear
from
other
Honda
Amaze
and
Brio
owners
if
they
have
experienced

Now

own
this

I
can
say
"I
am

of
HONDA
AMAZE
VXI.
Its
New

comfort

to
Knock
out

nearest
competitors
like
SAIL

SWIFT
Dezire

Etios
etc
who
all
have
contemprary

basic

features
are
available
except
few
like
No

but
AC
is
very
effective
even
at
40
degrees


rain
censors
etc.
&
no
innovation
or
changes
in
the
DASH
it
is
as
same
of
BRIO.
But
that
doesn't
make
any
different
or
count
while
looking
at
the
overall
bundled
package.
Though
is
is
not
as
dynamically
accomplished
like
Fiesta
&
Verna
but
Honda's
reliability

fuss-free

also
matters.

if
compared

like

has
really
done
good

it
less

One
doesn't
even
hear
the

comment

as
I
am
just
2
days
old
owner
of
the

But
I
am
sure
it
will
deliver
upto
my
expectations
after
3rd

is
done.

Happy
that
I
booked
it

surely
shift
business
dynamics
&
the
market
share
from
Maruti

to

Definitely
a
Tough

all
is
fine

to

I
took

once
again
I
have
given
the

are

it.
They
too

I
bought
my
Honda
Amaze
from
Whitefield
Honda
in
Bangalore.
I
chose
this
car
for
easy
city
driving
and
mileage.
But
this
turned
out
to
be
the
worst
decision
I
ever
made.
Its
just
6
weeks
since
I
purchased
this
car
-
I
was
in
the
traffic
one
day
and
all
of
a
sudden
smoke
started
coming
out
of
the
bonnet.
I
called
the
Honda
service
and
they
came
and
took
the
car
to
their
service
center

Whitefield
Honda
.
They
checked
the
vehicle
and
told
me
that
the
problem
was
with
the
clutch
and
I
have
to
replace
it.
As
the
warranty
does
not
cover
the
clutch
problem
-
I
 had
to
pay
Rs.9
500/-
to
get
the
vehicle
done. 
 
The
biggest
disaster
is
that
when
they
returned
the
vehicle

there
were
plenty
of
scratches
on
the
front
bumper
which
occurred
while
the
vehicle
was
being
towed
to
the
service
center.
On
asking
the
service
staff
-
they
told
me
that
nothing
can
be
done
about
it
and
they
didn't
even
care
to
do
anything
about
it.
I'm
very
disappointed
with
the
way
the
staff
dealt
the
whole
problem
and
would
never
recommend
this
car
or
the
dealer
to
anyone.
A
polo
or
a
Swift
Dzire
is
always
a
better
option.

Amaze
has
got
one
of
the
biggest
con
in
features.
It
is
the
AC.
Whenever
I
swithc
on
the
AC

a
very
foul
smell
starts
coming.
It
stays
for
abouty
a
minute
and
then
vanishes.
But
these
initial
seconds
make
you
restless
and
make
you
rethink"
Have
I
wasted
lakhs
to
smell
this
shit".
Other
point
is
the
efficiency
of
the
AC.
In
winter
it
feels
OK
but
during
summer

in
places
like
gujarat

the
car
struggles
to
perform
in
the
noon.
The
mileage
as
quoted
by
the
company
is
only
under
test
conditions.
If
you
have
a
normal
drive
in
the
city
with
AC
running

it
would
be
around
17-18
which
is
same
as
a
dzire
or
sail.
Boot
space
is
not
an
issue.
Its
quite
good.
One
more
con
is
the
non
adjustable
head
rest
in
the
front
and
rear
seats.
It
should
be
made
available
atleast
as
an
upgrade
option.

The
design
of
Honda
Amaze
at
the
lower
part
of
Bumper
is
very
poor.
Wherever
I
am
seeing
the
amaze
car

including
my
car

am
seeing
so
many
rough
scratches
on
that
area.
The
design
at
that
place
is
not
suitable
for
indian
road
conditions.
Next

the
shield
provided
at
the
lower
part
of
the
engine
is
fixed
with
body
by
buttons.
Since
there
is
only
5
buttons
at
the
front
side

it
is
very
easily
removing
due
to
indian
road
conditions.
No
other
top
brand
cars
are
having
button
like
fixtures
there.
It
was
unpinned
in
my
car.
when
i
went
to
honda
showroom
in
tirunelveli

they
said
to
replace
the
whole
engine
shield.
Its
cost
is
about
Rs.
4500. Just
for
the
damage
of
4
plastic
pins
why
should
we
replace
the
whole
shield.
Also

the
car
body
above
the
rear
wheels
is
easily
gets
scractes


it
can
be
modified.
otherwise
the
performance
is
good.

At

never

floored

was
able
to
monevour
even
from
uneven
and
broken
roads
withourt
touching
the
car
floor.
At
low
spped
sometimes
the
road
feel
is
there
but
at
high
spped
there
is
total
comfort.
The
head
light
needs
to
be
brightened
as
during
rainny
season
I
flet
a
difficulty
at
night.
In
two
years
the
only
difficulty
I
have
felt
is
in
the
locks.
 the
driver
lock
is
getting
a
little
dizzy
and
is
not
as
smooth
as
earlier.
The
key
sometimes
does
not
moves
smoothly.
The
tyre
and
the
jack
nees
to
be
fixed
so
that
in
cae
the
car
jumps
they
do
not
jump

the
inner
of
the
dicky
also
needs
some
make
over
or
covering.
My
view
overall
is
positive
for
the
car.

Final
Words
 I
bought
my
car
in
2013
and
it
has
completed
40
000
kms.
Service
costs
amount
to
Rs.
4
000

average

and
only
one
part
changed
since
then

brake
pads.
Car
is
still
performing
very
well
and
ya
there
is
cabin
noise
and
the
vibrations
in
the
car

but
noise
can
be
composated
with
the
car
stereo
system
and
generally
we
travel
with
our
stereos
switched
on
in
car. 
 
The
main
reason
I
bought
Amaze
is
the
Honda
Badge
comes
with
it
and
yes
the
service
centre
of
honda
is
very
good

they
listen
to
you
and
respond
to
it
accordingly.
The
parts
cost
is
higher
than
its
rivals
like
Maruti
but
the
cost
is
recovered
in
the
life
of
the
parts
and
frequency
of
change
of
oils
and
water.
For
eg.
Swift's
coolant
changes
on
every
20
000
kms
while
the
amaze's
change
near
1
00
000.
Please
ask
comparison
sheet
from
all
the
dealers
of
the
cars
in
this
segment
and
I
am
sure
you
will
find
Honds's
and
Toyota's
are
the
cheapest
to
own.
Areas
of
improvement  
 Cabin
noise
can
be
reduced
by
better
insualtion.
I
have
heard
there
is
a
hydrolock
problem
in
the
car

which
can
be
avoided
by
placing
intake
higher
like
in
swift.
Better
tires
shall
be
proivided
also
the
fifth
wheel
shall
be
alloy
also.
They
is
huge
scope
of
improving
the
interior
of
the
car
and
in
my
opiniom
the
exterior
requires
only
ome
improvement

the
day
light
led
and
the
projector
headlamps.
People
may
extra
50
000
bucks
to
buy
honda
with
improved
interior
and
exterior.

selling

7000

company
says
30%

no

If

see

add

its
all
fake.

Exterior Great
looks.
In
my
view

still
remains
the
best
looking
sub-4m
sedan
out
there.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort
 Lots
of
space

both
in
front
and
rear...the
boot
space
is
also
quite
good
for
a
decent
weeekend
travel.
Features
list
is
no
doubt
limited
as
compared
to
competition...but
its
adequate
for
a
normal
joe.
Nevertheless

Honda
definitely
should
look
to
improve
its
equipment
and
features
level.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox Excellent
with
no
turbo
lag
whatsoever.
Effortless
to
drive
in
city
conditions
and
gives
more
than
decent
performance
on
the
highways.
Mileage
as
discussed
in
many
other
reviews
is
great.
For
driving
till
speeds
of
90-110

it
will
give
a
great
mileage...only
in
speeds
more
than
that

the
mileage
starts
to
drop
swiftly.
In
city
drives

due
to
high
torque
and
no
turbo
lag

mileage
of
more
than
20
can
be
easily
achieved.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling Decent

although
the
suspension
could
have
been
a
little
softer.
Handling
is
good
with
EPS
weighing
properly
as
the
speed
progresses. 
Final
Words Overall
experience
of
the
car
has
been
amazing.
I
have
done
around
27k
Kms
with
the
car
now
in
around
17
months.
No
major
breakdowns

though
minor
rattles
are
there

the
same
have
been
manageable
to
a
large
extent.
The
car
has
been
used
primarily
for
my
daily
travel
to
office

around
70kms
to
and
fro

with
occasional
highway
trips
on
expressways

NHs

SHs

local
roads

no
roads

etc.When
i
purchased
the
car

the
only
option
in
the
competition
was
dzire...which
was
outrightly
rejected
due
to
its
design
and
looks.
If
given
an
option
now

i
would
probably
have
chosen
amaze
again
over
 xcent

due
to
its
poor
engine

diesel

and
driving
dynamics

and
zest
with
the
infamous
TATA
after
sales
service.
No
doubt
the
company
needs
to
improve
on
its
build
quality

engine
NVH
levels

lack
of
features

but
still
being
the
best
looker
of
the
segment

IMHO


presence
of
ABS

from
base
model


decent
driving
dynamics

better
than
xcent
for
sure


better
brakes

as
compared
to
dzire
especially
and
xcent
also

suddent
bite
problem


and
with
proven
performance
and
mileage
of
its
engine

amaze
remains
the
best
choice
in
this
segment
for
diesel.
 
In
petrol

i
cant
comment
much
as
i
have
not
used
it

but
without
the
ABS
in
its
base
models

and
with
the
engine
similar
as
the
competition

i
think
xcent
provides
a
better
option
with
more
features
at
lesser
price. 
Areas
of
improvement Engine
NVH
levels

and
also
provide
more

and

which
are
being

Full
Review

I
bought
my
the
Black
S
iDTEC
back
in
May
14.
I
have
to
say
performance
wise
and
mileage
has
given
me
smiles.
I
have
clocked
as
of
date
7500
kms
with
19-20
kms
per
litre
in
the
highway

with
AC

and
14-15
in
the
city.
Anyways
there
is
a
issue
of
Wheel
Freeze
or
hydrolocking
issue
if
you
drive
over
shallow
waterlogged
roads
at
speeds
above
120kms.
I
have
driven
over
the
same
at
150kms

thats
the
max
it
can
go

more
than
20-30
times
over
the
past
months
in
the
Bangalore
Salem
highway.
There
is
no
issue
when
driving
in
rains.
It
is
as
smooth
as
the
cadbury
chocolate.
I
have
tested
the
speeds
at
which
it
happens
and
below
120kms
the
car
is
smooth
when
you
drive
over
the
hallow
waterlogged
roads.
Else
the
Driver
needs
to
be
vigilant
or
you
could
loose
control.
Be
very
careful.
Else
no
other
flaw
i
could
come
accross.
Its
a
ok
car
+
good
performance
+
decent
mileage
at
the
price
they
are
selling.

I

the
best
and
the
worst
feature
of
the

relate
to
the
engine.
first
the
best
feature
and
that
is
the
fuel
economy.
If
I
drive
the
car
on
highways
and
at
a
constant
speed
of
60
-
65
km

i
get
an
astonishing
FE
of
29
KMPL.
In

city

I
drive
for

80
-90

and
the
emi
of
the
car
is
offset
against
the
savings
on
the
fuel
cost.
Now
the
worst
feature
and
that
is
the
engine
noise
and
vibrations.
I
feel
the
engine
noise
is
more
than
you
could
ask
for.
When
you
switch
off
the
engine

it
reminds
me
of
an
ambassodor
which
used
to
stop
with
a
thud.

Quality
&
Handling
The
handling

a
very
light

but
the
the
ride
quality
is
not
as
good
as
honda

The
suspension
of
the
car
is
on
the
harder
side
and
you
can
feelthe
bumps

jerks
on

Final
Words
If
you
are
driving
on
long
routes
and

your
main
concern
then
look
no

Exterior:
The
look
of
car
is
really
very
good.
It
looks
trendy.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort
:
The
space
in
the
rear
is
an
issue.
It
can
accomidate
2
adults
and
a
kid
comfortabally.
But

if
you
try
to
make
3
adults
sit

its
not
good.
Although
its
ok
when
going
a
short
distence

but
gets
really
very
uncomfortable
for
long
distence.
But
the
front
row
is
spacious
and
comfortable.
The
features
are
good.
The
finish
and
look 
has
got 
honda
City's

Second
Genaration

feel.
Overall
it
good.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox:
Let
me
clarify
here
that

the
engine
is
not
at
all
noisy.
The
cabin
is
also
very
much
noise
proof.
I
drove
it
for
450
K.M
Staight

but
did
not
feel
any
noise
or
vibration.
And
the
gear
box
is
smooth
like
butter.
The
fuel
economy
is
also
good.
It
gave
me
a
milage
of
21
K.M
Per
liter
with
A/C

which
is
actually
good
for
my
kind
of
driving.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling:
As
I
have
already
stated

the
ride
quality
is
an
issue
in
the
real
row.
The
Suspensions
are
really
hard.
So

hard
that
I
felt
like
sitting
in
a
Fiat
Premier
Padmini. 
You
can
actually
feel
each
and
every
hump
and
jurks
on
he
road.
So

my
humble
request
to
Honda
people
is
to
make
the
suspension
a
bit
softer

actually
a
lot
softer.
The
handling
is
awsome.
I
drove
it
on
plain
roads

rough
roads

hilly
roads

in
rain

everywhere
it
passed
with
flying
colours.
Final
Words:
Don't
think
much

if
you
are
planning
to
buy
it

thewn
just
go
for
it.

2nd

It
is
having
the
noise
at

as
well
as
on

So
I
rejected
the

and
booked
other
diesel

It
is
as

even
the

Just
wanted
others
to
know
that
after
I
have
deposited
the
money..HONDa
put
the
price
up
by
15000rs
and
said
that
untill
I
get
the
car

I
have
have
to
pay
whatever
the
price
difference
is
and
the
waiting
time
is
1
month
in
gujarat.
I
mean
new
entry
in
diesel
and
they
let
other
take
and
advantage
with
this
silly
things.
I
heard
about
engine
as
they
are
new
in
diesel
version.
I
am
going
to
buy
honda
now
but
they
will
have
one
VERY
UNHAPPY
AND
NOT
SATISFIED
customer.
This
is
very
competative
market
and
other
brands
always
looking
for
your
faults
and
they
had
2
to
3
now.
I
think
chevrolet
sail
would
have
been
better
option
with
this
new
HONDA
AMAZE
DIESEL.
New
buyers

be
clear
what
you
buying.
I
havent
driven
it
yet
but
already
unsatisfied.
They
gave
me
the
wrong
leaflet
at
the
first
place
with
wrong
colour
option
in
2nd
diesel
category
so
I
have
to
go
for
3rd
one
later
which
cost
me
more
just
coz
of
color.
Brand
value
is
there

I
saw
interior
quite
nice

excellent
fuel
economy
and
1.5

Honda
has
finally
entered
the
diesel
vehicle
segment
in
the
country
with
the
launch
of
the
compact
sedan
Amaze.
Launched
in
both
petrol
and
diesel
variants

the
Honda
Amaze
aims
to
be
the
first
real
challenge
for Maruti
Suzuki's
Swift
DZire.The
lowest
petrol
variant
of
the
Honda
Amaze
is
priced
at Rs. 4.99
lakh

while
the
top
two
variants

both
automatics

will
cost Rs. 6.62
lakh
and Rs. 7.5
lakh.
The
base
diesel
variant
is
priced
at Rs. 5.99
lakh

while
the
top-end
one
costs Rs. 7.6
lakh.The
diesel
variant
sports
a
1.5
i-DTEC
engine

developed
specially
for
the
Indian
market

and
has
a
fuel
efficiency
of
25.8
km
per
litre

according
to
the
company.
It
has
been
derived
from
Honda's
1.6
i-DTEC
which
sells
in
Europe.
The
same
engine
will
subsequently
be
used
in
next
generation
models
of
the
City

Jazz
and
Brio
starting
next
year.The
petrol
model
has
the
same
1.2-litre
i-VTEC
engine
as
the
Brio
and
the
Jazz

and
will
have
fuel
efficiency
of
18
km/litre

the
company
says.
The
automatic
variants
will
run
15.5
km
per
litre
of
fuel."The
Amaze
is
our
most
strategic
model
in
the
Indian
market
and
has

with

focus
on

In

Amaze
doesn't
look

any

is
a

superb

curves.
People
will
stand
and
look
at
curvacious
body.
Best
view
of
the
car
is
from
the
rear.
It
looks
very
sexy

stylish
and
 more

younger

 Space
and
comfort
is
great
considering
it
is
a
sub-compact
car.
Car
is
not
rich
in
features.
Basic
things
like
power
outlet
or
cigarette
lighter
point
does
not
come
in
base
version.
Even
my
Maruti
800
had
cigaretter

about
7
years
back.

 One
of
the
best
diesel
engines
in
India.
First
day
after
taking
the
delivery
I
started
getting
fuel
efficieny
of
18.2
kmpl.
It
is
two
days
since
I
bought
my
car.
I
have
travelled
about
200
kms

already
I
am
getting
a
FE
of
20
kmpl
per
litre

diesel
.
Engine
performance
is
the
best
part
of
the
car.
It
is
as
powerful
as
Innova
meant
for
carrying
7
or
8
people.
Overtaking
is
a
breeze.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
Ride
quality
and
handling
is
good.
Very
precise
steering.
Best
for
ladies
who
fear
that
my
car
might
go
somewhere
and
hit.
You
point
the
steering
and
press
the
pedal

car
will
go
straight
there.
Final
Words
 Value
for
money
car.
You
will
be
amazed
every
millisecond
you
are
in
the
car.
I
would
vote
this
as
the
best
car
of
2013
amoung
launches.
I
would
not
have
bought
this
car

if
I
had
not
accidentally
walked
into
Dakshin
Honda
showroom
on
Lavelle
road.
One
test
drive
made
me
to
change
my
decision
and
booked
this
car
instead
of
Ritz
Vdi-ABS.
Probably
it
is
the
only
car
in
the
country
where
even
base
versions
come
with
ABS-EBD.
Thanks
to
Honda
for
considering
safety
of
passangers
rather
than
trying
to
make
money.
Areas
of
improvement  
 NVH
needs
to
be
in
level
with
Dzire.
Honda
needs
to
advertise
on
TV
and
print
media
more.
Many
people
are
not
aware
of
it's
great
power

mileage

space
and
comfort.
Dealer
network
should
be
strengthened
in
all
cities
of
India
to
pull
the
crowd
away
from
Maruti.
Finally
most
important
point
from
Indian
consumers
point
of
view

spare
parts
must
be
cheap

you
cannot
charge
exhorbitant
price
for
accessories.

Interiors
are
not

impressive
though
they
could
have
done
a
better
job
however
seats
are
very
well
designed
and
comfortable

the
best
point
is
that
the
rear
seats
are
so
spacious
with
an
arm
rest
is
a
plus
point
while
compared
to
other
models
in
this
segment.
Lot
of
space
to
stow
your
water
bottles
and
the
front
seat
is
curved
from
back
side
to
make
more
room
sitting
in
the
rear
seat....
they
should
have
provided
back
seat
pouches
for
storage.
The
best
part
is
the
trunk
and
it
is
of
400
liters
which
is
very
essential
for
an
average
Indian
family
while
travelling
out
of

this
is
a
clear
cut

and
performs
pretty
well
even
in
the
busy

traffic

As
regards
to
the
fuel
economy
it
is
pretty
good
but
not
to
the
promises
of
Honda

for
sure
it
returns
the

Ride
Quality
&
Handling
Ride
quality
is
very
smooth
as
accepted
and
handles
very
well
as
the
steering
response
is
immense
and
the
turning
radius
is
fantastic.
It
gives
a
great
feel
while
driving
and
never
makes
you
feel
that
you
are
driving

Final
Words
Very
good
car
but
to
my
feeling
it
is
a
bit
over
priced
and
they
should
have
considered
a
better
interiors
and
some
latest
features
like
Blue
tooth
etc.

Areas
of
improvement
I
thoroughly
feel
that
they
should
have
given
a
push
button
start
in
all
the
variants
and
also
should
seriously
consider
upgrading
the
interiors.
Must
add
an
armrest
to
the
drivers
seat
for
the
comfort.
They
should
think
of
a
better
music
system
than
that
of
the
existing
one.
They
should
have
incorporated
an
airbag
at
least
for
the
driver.

I
had
running
of
12
000
KM.I
shifted
from
Tata
Indica
DSL
to
Amaze.
I
used
Indica
for
around
9
years
and
was
satisfied
with
the
car
and
its
overall
performance.
It
was
really
Value

Exterior Good
Looks

are
properly
placed
and
covers
maximum
possible
 area.
Also
electronically
mirror
adjustment
and
folding
from
inside
is
very
comfortable.
Quality

the
body
metal
is
very
thin
and

quality
is
poor.
I
had
taffeta
white
colour
car
and
its
paint
quality
is
very
poor.
Design/placing
of
the
wheel
need
to
improve.
If
road
is
rough

it
throws
small
stones
on
the
external
part
of
the
car
sides
and
because
of
this
there
are
dents
on
side
body
the
next
to
rare
doors
of
the
car.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort
 Very
good
space
and
comfort
for
driving
Quality
of
material
use
for
interior
is
average.
Size
of
the
glove
box
is
very
small.
I
am
not
sure
if
the
placing
of
steering
axel
rod
is
proper

because
when
we
press
the
clutch

steering
axel
rod
touches
to
our
feet
and
we
can
sense
its
movement.
It
is
definitely
not
a
comfort
feeling
and
has
concern
about
safety

because
 it
gives
uncomfortable
feeling
of
thinking
about
immediate
impact
of
this
rod
in
case
of
an
accident.
Boot
Space
is
very
good
among
the
various
options
available
in
this
segment.
Dicey
door
is
not
covered
from
inside.
The
space
between
dicey
doors
external
sheet
and
inter
plates/rods
is
open
and
visible.
It
could
create
a
problem
if
and
part
of
the
luggage
or
say
handle
of
bat/stick
etc.
stuck
in
it
then
it
may
get
locked
from
inside
or
even
a
small
parts
of
luggage
may
stuck
into
it.
If
it
would
have
covered
with
a
small
piece
of
board
sheet

I
do
not
think
that

it
would
have
much
cost
impact.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox Engine
is
little
bit
noisy

 I
was
expecting
smoothing
of
its
noise
after
running
for
10k
kms

but
it
is
not
so.
If
there
are
limitations
in
reducing
in
built
noise
of
the
engine

still
in
the
present
case
it
could
have
suppress
to
a
large
extent
if
it
provides
a
thick
and
bigger
fabric/canvas
sheet
as
inner
to
bonnet
of
the
engine.
The
present
size
of
the
sheet
is
very
small
and
also
it
is
very
thin.
Gearbox
is
hard.
It
is
informed
that

the
gear
box
is
of
polymer
material
and
not
of
the
metal.
For
me
it
developed
a
little
muscle
/
ligament
pain
in
the
left
palm.
Fuel
economy
claim
by
the
Company
is
misleading.
In
the
city
70%

and
Highway
30%

average
fuel
economy
is
around
16.3
km/ltr.
 My
9
years
old
Tata
Indica
car
was
giving
better
fuel
economy
than
this
new
car.

Final

carry
the
banding
and

of

it

this
is
the
biggest
failure
in
this

this
is
mileage
was
noted
on
delhi
to
bombay
throughout
the
highway
nonstop
in
19
hrs
of
single
man
drive

embarrasement
was
hitting
highly
when
Swift

over
takes
you
on

@
150
km/hr
above
and
hitting
mileage
of
not
less
than
20km/l
throughout
this

The
mileage
meter
shown
in
this
car
is
just
a
show
piece

before
every
drive
you
reset
it
and
keep
noting
the
reading
on
a
piece
of
paper
like
we
use
to
do
in
old
Maruti
800's
or
Fiat

pal


on
every

it
shows
mileage
more
than
25.8
if
you
drive
it
at
the
speed
of
60-75km/hr

but
express
ways
are
not
made
to
drive
at
60

80

one
tend
to
touch
above
100
because
speed
=
distance/time
and
time
=
$$
money
so
if
u
have
more
excess
time
than
you
may
ride
at
65
km/hr
and
wait
for
the
meter
to
claim
mileage
of
32km/l
also
I've
waited
and
even
got
the
reading
till
29
km/l
which
company
straight
away
refused
&said
that
this
is
not
possible

I
have
clicked
some
images
also

and
another
thing

once
u
top
up
the
fuel
tank
reset
the
mileage
meter
and
stand
on
idle
with
a/c
on
for
half
n
hour
or
more
the
mileage
meter
will
come
down
to
as
low
as
1
km/ltr.
So
the
mileage
meter
is
just
to
satisfy
you
that
u
drive
slowly
and
it
may
show
above
22
or
so

and
belive
me
every
time
you
go
for
a
mileage
test
in

they
will
immediately
reset
the
mileage
meter
and
drive
car
like
on
a
test
mode
very
slowly
and
in
5
minutes
the
meter
will
show
you
above
19

and
they
will
say
that
this
is
the
mileage
this

is
giving
in

and
on

it
will
give
more.

engine
grabs
all

the
surge
of

starts
kicking

from
as
low
as
1300

which
prompts
you

shift
gears
quickly
and
there
is
virtually
no
turbo
lag
felt
which
makes
it
easier
to
drive.
I
have
completed
800
kms
of
driving
on
this
car
after
I
took
delivery
on
4th
Sep
which
includes
a
maiden
trip
of
Mumbai-Pune
expressway

mileage
I
am
getting
currently

at
17.7

Gearbox

not

Ride
Quality
&
Handling Figo
Aspire's
suspension
handles
minor
bumps
and
bad
roads
with
ease
and
there
is
not
much
body
roll
felt.
Overall
handling
of
the
car
is
good
however
on
the
highway
under
steering
is
experienced
around
sharp
corners
due
to
small
OEM
tyre
size.
NVH
levels
inside
the
cabin
is
excellent

Steering
is
very
light
to
operate
in
the
city.
Turning
radius
at
4.9m
provides
good
maneuverability.
Final
Words Diesel
engine
is
the
star
performer
for
Ford
here
and
I
am
very
satisfied
with
the
overall
pre-sales

delivery
and
initial
ownership.
This
is
my
first
diesel
car
and
after
selling
my
Petrol

LT

Chevrolet
Beat
I
am
pinning
my
hopes
on
a
reasonably
hassle
free
after
sales
service
from
dealer
and
the
company.
Areas
of
improvement There
are
some
noticeable
panel
gaps
around
headlight
cluster

boot
section
and
front
bumper
though
not
very
wide
however
it
is
not
expected
from
a
car
of
this
category
and
navigating
on
USB
to
access
music
across
folders
is
very
distracting

which
makes
it
better
to
stick
to
listening
to
music
via
Bluetooth.
If
you
like
pushing
car
around
corners
and
prefer
better
stability
to
mileage
then
swapping
of
OEM
tyres
is
mandatory.

no
need
to
put
it
on
the
whole
time.Sound
system
is
excellent
and
sufficient
with
4
speakers.A
really
good
feature
is
the
aux
point
and
usb
point
in
the
MyFordDock
panel
which
can
be
used
easily
with
no
worry
of
the
phone
tripping
over
even
in
bridge
traffics
and
panic
braking.Steering
wheel
itself
has
a
control
panel
of
this
infotainment
system
so
no
need
to
extend
to
that
main
panel.It
even
has
bluetooth
connectivity
to
phones
and
other
devices
and
feature
to
import
all
contacts.The
cabin
insulation
also
is
really
good
and
feels
neglegible
discomfort
when
goes
through
a
pot
hole.

Engine
is
really
powerful
and
rev
it
beyond
1700
rpm
and
it
is
just
a
joy
to
ride.The
torque
is
excellent
215Nm
is
really
good
enough
for
this
segment.Apparently
no
presence
of
turbo
lag....can
even
ride
as
low
as
15kmph
from
3rd
gear.Currently
she
gives
me
15kmpl
in
the
cities
but
then
again
i
ride
around
1st
and
2nd
around
3000
rpm
so
its
a
different
story
but
when
driven
perfectly
it
gave
around
20-22
kmpl
which
was
with
AC
off.The
gearbox
is
smooth
no

there.

Ride
Qualty
is
good
as
I
mentioned
above
absorbs
all
the
bumps
and
holes
smoothly.Even
when
it
is
at
higher
speeds
of
upto
130-140
it
feels
under
control.The
steering
response
is
good
and
helps
alot
in
city
traffic
and
highways
as
well.
Final
Words
I
was
suggested
by
other
people
to
go
for
other
car
in
the
same
segment
but
we
went
for
this
one
and
except
one
minor
problem
of
the
speakers
not
playing
which
was
internally
disturbed
because
i
wasnt
used
to
the
new
cars
pickup
and
torque....hehe
took
me
2
dasy
to
get
used
to
it
but
the
ford
service
guys
responded
quickly
and
took
the
car
to
service
centre
the
same
day
itself.Kuddos
for
Wasan
Ford
in
Bombay.All
things
apart
Aspire
is
an
excellent
family
car
and
has
good
power
good
fuel
economy
good
space
and
importantly
lots
of
safety
and
practicality.Value
for
money.
Areas
of
improvement  
Honestly
please
include
the
driver
seat
height
adjustment
no
problem
for
men
while
driving
but
women
need
one.Include
the

necessary
in
big
cities.Havent
come
across
anything
else
other
than
this.

Exterior
Looks
really
interesting

agressiveness
combined
with
elegance

as
it
has
a
unique
grill

reminds
me
of
good
old
Ambi

and
swept
back
headlight
cluster
make
it
stand
of
the
crowd.
Although
it
is
a
sub-four
meter
car

the
proportions
are
best
in-class.
The
side
profile
looks
very
sober

chrome
door
cladding
can
be
added
liven
it
up

-
this
is
where
the
14
inch
wheels
look
smaller
-
15
inch
would
look
a
lot
better.
The
rear
looks
bit
odd

common
issue
in
CS
segment

and
has
been
kept
simple
with
horizontal
chrome
cladding
-
it
has
enough
luggage
space
for
a
small
family.
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

The
build
quality
of
the
cabin
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
in
the
segment.
The
moment
you
step
into
the
car

you
can
realize
the
amount
of
space
it
has
to
offer

just
fantastic.
During
Indian
summer

you
can
keep
yourself
and
family
very
comfortable
as
this
car
has
a
very
powerful
AC
-
also
the
Ford
technician
told
me
that
AC
load
is
distributed
between
battery

80%

and
engine

20%

so
driving
performance
is
not
compromised.
The
instrument
cluster
is
small
but
looks
nice
and
clear
with
light
blue/cyan
color
-
other
systems

engine
warning

overheating

seatbelt

high/low
beam

fogs
etc

have
different
colors.
Another
major
feature
is
the
docking
station

which
can
hold
your
phone/GPS
device
for
ease
of
use.
The
USB
and
Aux
are
built
into
the
rare
of
docking
station.
The
steering
mounted
audio/media
controls
are
nice
easy
to
use.
There
are
lot
of
cubby
holes
and
bottle
holders
-
but
none
at
the
rare.
The
front
seats
are
wide
and
very
comfortable
for
long
trips
-
recommed
to
get
seat
covers
for
longivity.
Both
front
and
rare
seat
headrests
are
adjustable.The
center
console
is
similar
to
that
of
Eco-sport
and
Fiesta
-
looks
smart
and
elegant.
It
has
multiple
connectivity
options
-
Aux

Bluetooth

USB

Phone
book
sync/dial
feature
etc

Ford
MyKey
and
Sync
features
are
available
in
top
end
variant
.
The
USB
requires
FAT32
format
or
it
may
throw
an
error
:
.
The
lights
are
managed
interestingly
and
has
been
put
seperately
on
the
right
side
below
the
steering.
The
rare
windows
do
not
go
down
completely
-
10%
remains
visible.
Rare
seats
get
central
arm-rest
adding
to
the
comfort
factor.
 
Overall
I
like
the
way
everything
falls
to
hand
so
nicely. 
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox
Most
importantly

how
does
it
performe
on
the
road?
To
answer
it
straight

You
will
simply
fall
in
Love
with
the
1.5
TDCi
:

It
is
not
a
brand
new
engine
-
it
has
been
delivering
power
to
Feista

Eco-sport
but
has
been
fine
tuned
for
more
power

100
PS

and
better
mileage.
The
dirivability
and
refinement
levels
are
fantastic.
It
does
not
hesitate
and
can
easily
pick-up
in
3rd
gear
from
low
as
15
kmph.
The
amount
of
torque

215
Nm

available
across
the
rev-range
is
briliant.
The
fixed
geometry
turbo
kicks
in
early

1400
RPM
approx

making
driving
in
trafic
effortless

giving
quick
reaction
.
I
have
noticed
that
even
you
are
in
2
or
3
gear
and
do
not
press
the
accelarator

the
car
accelarates
on
its
own

torque
talks
here

:
.
You
can
only
hear
the
engine
when
its
idling

standstill

or
when
pushed
over
3K
RPM
-
that
means
good
NVH
level
inside
cabin.
This
engine
is
matted
to
a
5
speed
tranmission
and
has
short
and
precise
throws
-
making
things
more
exciting
for
the
driver.
In
city
runs

office
-
home

with
AC
on
full
time

it
should
return
19-21
kmpl

with
light
foot

-
which
is
Great
:

The
steering
is
light
and
chunky
to
hold.
It
weighs
nicely
up
as
you
pick
up
speed. 
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
Ford
cars
have
been
known
for
their
ride
and
handling
qualities
and
this
one
is
no
different
:

It
has
been
further
optimized
for
Indian
roads
and
makes
the
car
glide
over
pot-holes
or
bumpy
roads.
On
highways
it
behaves
like
a
well
oiled
machine
-
stable

composed
and
poised
at
high
speeds
-
giving
a
lot
of
confidence
to
driver
and
passengers. 
The
unique
thing
about
Aspire
is
that
it
comes
with
2
front
airbags
as
standard
across
all
variants

top
end
gets
6
airbags

-
this
is
the
class
leading
feature
in
this
segment. 
Final
Words
If
you
are
looking
for
safe

comfortable

efficient
and
exciting
to
drive
car?
Well
look
no
further

the
Ford
Figo
Aspire
is
just
for
you.
It
is
so
much
fun
to
drive
that
you
may
want
to
drive
it
on
and
on
and
on...
:
.
Although
Ford
is
late
to
the
party

segment
already
has
Maruti
Swift
Desire

Hyundai
Xcent

Honda
Amaze
and
Tata
Zest


but
after
driving
the
Ford
Figo
Aspire

I
am
confident
that
it
has
potential
to
top
the
list.
Areas
of
improvement  
I
found
the
outer
body/pannel
light
weight
-
it
virbrates
if
car
audio
volume
is
high

80+%

-
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
lightness
of
this
vehicle
-
just
over
a
1
ton.
The
pannel
gaps
are
wide
-
they
could
have
been
reduced.
The
rare
bumper
is
almost
flat
and
does
not
provide
any
cover/protection
to
boot
lid
-
any
rare
impact
may
cause
body
damage.
There
is
no
engine
cover

as
in
Fiesta
or
Eco-sport

although
it
has
provision
for
a
cover.

My
Fav
car
is
Hyundai
Verna

Though
I
couldn't
afford
a
diesel
version
of
it

so
I
thought
of
looking
in
to
any
other
car
that
comes
below
8
lacs
price
tag.
Then
I
met
in
love
with
this
fantastic
car
called
Ford
Aspire.
I
really
surprised
to
see
that
this
is
almost
equal
to
Verna
in
all
departments.
Exterior New
and
Great
fresh
look
with
the
Aston

On

premium

If

give

it
needs
no
elaboration
as
even
a
person
who
hasn't
driven
the
zest
himself
will
vouch
for
its
cute

must
say
it
is
a
stunner
in

No

about
it
and
i
have
no
qualms
in
mentioning
that
it
is
indeed
a
feature
rich
car.
Tata
Designers

Developers
&
Engineers
have
spared
no
efforts
to
incorporate
every
little
conceivable
safety

feature
in
the

And
to
top
the
charts

the
icing
on
the
cake
is
a
very
high
end
 Harmaan
Audio
System.
I
purchased
my
zest
xt
in
January
2015
and
I
have
come
to
know
that
the
present
zest
models
in
the
market
are
even
offering
navigation
and
video
play
back
feature
also.
The
car
is
very
comfortable
on
long
rides

suspension
is
pretty
decent
provided
you
don't
deliberately
jump
the
car
over
large
Pot-holes.
Engine
Noise
inside
the
cabin
is
almost
negligible

considering
its
a
diesel
engine.
Gear
shift
is
very
smooth
and
no
vibration
in
the
gear
stick.
I
don't
know
what
R&D
Tata
has
done
with
the
Steering
but
after
driving
Zest
when
 you
drive
any
other
car
with
power
steering

you
will
definately
feel
that
you
are
driving
a
vehicle
sans
the
power
steering.
In
short

Power
Steering
in
Zest
is
super
smooth
&
light
and
feels
equally
sturdy
on
Highways
at
high
speeds.
You
don't
feel
fatigued
after
travelling
long
distance
due
to
the
high
driving
position
&
comfortable
seats.
A
sore
point
is
Tata
failed
to
provide
sufficient
storage
spaces
&
bottle
holders
inside.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox Engine
performance
is
good
&
very
refined

considering
its
the
tried
&
tested
Fiat
1.3
Quadrajet
engine.
Power
delivery
is
good
as
the
engine
is
tuned
to
90
PS.
It
depends
upon
an
individual's
driving
style

so
if
someone
is
in
the
habit
of
pressing
on
the
gas
in
the
second
gear
then
he
might
feel
a
lil
disappointed
as
the
real
power
kicks
in
the
3rd
and
4th
gear
when
the
Turbo
surges
in.
Over
taking
is
no
problem
and
you
get
the
desired
 power
to
race
ahead
when
needed
on
the
highway.
In
city
driving

Delhi
&
Gurgaon
I'm
getting
a
mileage
of
14
kmpl
with
AC
and
on
the
Highway
I've
managed
18
Kmpl
with
AC
and
you
would
be
pleasantly
surprised
when
you
will
see
your
zest
returning
impressive
figures
of
17-18
kmpl
while
driving
in
hills.
One
really
nice
feature
in
the
car
is
the
Avg.
fuel
consumption
meter
and
believe
me
its
not
off
the
mark.
I
have
noticed
that
by
calculating
the
mileage
by
completely
filling
the
fuel
tank
and
then
filling
it
again

the
figures
i
got
were
almost
comparable
with
the
figures
displayed
by
the
avg
fuel
meter.
Gear
shift
is
very
smooth
as
mentioned
above.
  
Ride
Quality
&
Handling Ride
Quality
&
handling
is
superb. 
Final
Words Considering
the
parking
woes
in
NCR
I
planned
to
buy
a
compact
sedan
in
the
sub
4
meter
category
and
Zest
completely
fitted
the
bill
and
has
not
disappointed
me
at
all.
If
you
are
in
the
process
of
buying
a
sedan
then
my
advise
would
be
to
go
for
zest
as
no
point
in
buying
a
Verna
or
Honda
City
for
that
matter.
You
will
end
up
shelling
out
a
few
lacs
more
for
less
inner
space

a
marginal
powerful
engine
and
hyped
up
brands.
 
Areas
of
improvement More
Storage
space
should
be
provided
inside
the
car.

be
considered
as
a

alternative
to
Amaze

which
I
didn't
find

I
have

the

is
just
14
in

am

saying
that
they
get
17

20

So
somebody

Driving
a
automatic
car
is
very
very
easy.
The
car
looks
very
good
except
for
the
front
grill
it
reminds
me
of
indica
taxi

daylight
looks
gud
and
the
tail
lamp
lights
are
great.would
have
loved
a
body
coloured
lower
bumber.
The
leg
room
is
great
and
the
interior
has
a
great
quality
and
finish.
Would
have
been
better
if
leather
seats
were
availble.
Infotainmnet

blowing

Would
have
been
best
if
reverse
camera
could
be
integrated
into
the
infotainment
system.
Engine
works
fine.
Easy
to
handle
and
overtaking
is
hassel
free.
Mileage
started
to
improve
now
14
but
car
is
purchased
three
weeks
before
so
its
good
and
it
will
improve.
Easy
to
corner
at
high
speeds.
Speed
increases
at
a
good
rate.
Just
a
small
lag
when
shifting
from
first
to
second.

have
added
a

for

Covered

in
one
day.
On
Bengaluru-Mysuru
highway

I
got
23.8
kms
pl.
That's
just
wondeful.
And
overall
for
the
entire
trip
I
got
21.6kms
pl.
This
was
sometimes
with
bumper

AC
most
of
the

I
took

a
very
good
product
from
the
Tatas.
Hope
the

will
improve
on
this

that

at
the

have

have
not

riding.
Lot

I
wouldn't

went

purchase
XMA.

as
you
can

level
model
of
verna
with
this
money


but
not
at
all
bad
as
well

might
end
up
being
second
or
third
based
on
exterior
looks

Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort
 The
interiors
of
the
car
are
as
inviting
as
non
other
car's

in
this
price

would
be.
The
features
are
awesome

with
navigation
system
and
a
good
responsive
touch
screen.
This
is
the
most
spacious
and
comfortable
car
one
can
fetch
in
this
price
range.
In
fact

the
car's
rear
seat's
recine
angle
is
said
to
be
more
comfortable
than
the
Mercedes
Benz
S-Class.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox The
engine
is
a
great
performer
and
one
can
easily
clock
150
kmph

if
the
road
allows
you
to.
Also

the
car
gives
no
lags
in
performance
even
if
the
AC
is
kept
to
its
fullest.
The
economy
might
be
somewhat
around
18
to
20
overall.
The
gearbox
is
swift
and
its
quite
easy
to
shift
the
gears.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling The
ride
quality
and
handling
is
a
differentiating
factor
for
this
car
and
the
others
at
this
price.
Its
great
to
be
at
the
driver's
seat.
The
steering
is
as
much
responsive
as
it
should
be.
Even
the
suspension
is
worth
a
praise.
Final
Words
- Overall

with
all
the
good
features
and
one
or
two
odd
negatives

the
car
stands
to
be
a
great
value
for
money
and
a
must
buy
if
you
have
8
lacs
to
spare.
Areas
of
improvement As
mentioned
in
the
cons

the
NVH
insulation
needs
to
be
improved.
And
seeing
the
size
of
the
car

a
rear
parking
sensor
should
be
added.
Also

because
of
the
space
inside
the
cabin

the
car
seriously
requires
rear
AC
vents

which
are
now
available
in
Xcent

July
2015

your

concorde

I
need
to

this.
If
so
what
did
they
check
and
how
was
this
concluded
stating
nothing
needs

Concorde

told
me
that
this

a
common

with
Manza

they
didnt

Why
do
you
need
to
remind
me
that
this
was
a

car
when
complaints
arises?
I

On

6:30pm
during

you
had
communicated
that
turbo
issue
will
be
checked
on
17th?
Do
you
admit
this?
So
how
can
you
say
that
this
was
checked
on
16th?
Concorde
service
manager
had
called
you
back
while
leaving
to
have
a

with
me.
Or
did
you

after
6:30pm
?

warranty
of
my
car
is
void?
6.
Do
you
have
any
proofs
to
support
that
they
have
checked
this
issue?
Concorde
engineer
had
told
me
that
this
is
a
common
issue
with
Manza
and
they
didnt
check
this.
7.
Now
you
are
saying
things
differently.
On
16th
you
had
told
that
service
should
have
done
by
12
months
after
3rd
service.
Now
you
are
saying
that
it
should
be
done
by
24
months
or
30000
kms
after
purchase.
Can
you
please
clarify
which
is
correct?
Do
you
have
any
confusions
or
do
you
need
to
check
this
again
with
your
manager?
If
this
is
24
months
then
it
should
be
scheduled
on
April
2015.
I
had
clearly
told
the
reason
for
not
doing
the
service
on
April.
Also
when
I
told
this
you
said
that
if
it
was
a
gap
of
3
months
then
you
would
have
replaced
the
turbo
in
extended
warranty.
You
are
repeatedly
changing
your
words
in
the
presence
of
your
colleagues
and
managers.
Jibin

I
think
you
are
seeing
this
loop
of
mails.
Can
you
please
clarify
with
Krishnan
about
this
and
get
back
to
me
on
this?

then
they

the

they
could

there
are
some
people
who
helped
me
in

But
most
of
the
harsha
toyota
is
worst
in
customer
services

some
thmes
they
say
it
is
not

give
you
high

service
for
the

They
make
you
to

a
package
called

the
exact
meaning
behind
it
is
ucry
wesmile.
at
the
end
they
will
appolizise
you

they
wiil
say
this
will
not

again
and
will
give
discounts

extra
benifits

your
next

but
the
time
comes
to

they
will
say
this
the
best
we
can
do
and
ntg
els
we

but
the
prices
are
abit
high
with
them
when

Dear
Sir

We
are
suffering
till
today
for
following:
1.
Car
is
without
number
plate

No
documents
of
RTO
submitted
.
2.
No
mats
in
the
car
and.
3.
Zero
Depreciation
Insurance
not
given
whereas
we
had
paid
for
it.
4.
No
account
of
payments
given.
5.
They
are
not
taking
any
phone
calls
now.
Other
things
as
mentioned
earlier
are
also
their
which
are
out
of
reconciliation.
My
detailed
mail
to
Customer
care
remained
unattended
so
attached
below.
Dear
Sir

Further
to
mail
below
we
are
to
inform
you
that
today
also
we
tried
to
contact
both
Mr.
Pramod
Singh
+91842583XXXXXX
and
Ms.
Anju
+919664XXXXXX
more
than
10
times
but
both
are
not
answring
the
calls.
To
our
surprise
we
received
a
call
from
+912241XXXXXX
that
our
number
plat
has
been
made
but
they
do
not
have
any
person
to
deliver.The
person

a
girl

called
refused
to
disclose
her
name.
She
was
not
aware
about
the
car
mats.
Your
immediate
intervention
is
required
otherwise
we
will
be
boud
to
move
the
consumer
court.
 Dear
Sir

We
are
to
inform
further
that
the
dealer's
representative
had
sent
the
vehicle
to
our
residence
without
proper
documents
i.e.
1.
No
car
Number
and/or
No
RTO
documents
2.
We
had
paid
additioanl
Insurance
premium
of
about
Rs.
7
700/
for
Zero
Depreciation
but
only
a
normal
Insurance
policy
had
been
taken.
3.
Receipt
of
amount
paid
and
relevant
bills
of
amount
appropriated
not
given
Car
had
been
sent
with
a
new
driver
without
any
company
representativ.
Further
we
are
told
that
the
car
can
not
be
used
without
car
number
so
if
you
want
to
use
then
use
it
at
your
risk.
They
have
not
given
essential
asseories
worth
Rs.
3
000/
like
mats
etc
as
mentioned
in
price
list
whereas
they
promised
us
to
give
the
same
without
any
additional
charges
as
part
of
December
booking
discount.
Their
are
so
many
other
issues
in
the
car
which
are
unable
to
state
in
the
mail.
Hence
we
have
not
accepted
the
delivery
of
the
car
as
a
good
delivery.
They
told
us
that
they
will
call
us
today
but
till
now
no
phone
call
received
they
have
switched
off
their
mobiles.
 
You
are
advised
to
take
action
on
priority
and
look
in
to
this.
 Dear
Sir

We
have
booked
a
Renault
Scala
desile
car
at
your
VASHI
NEW
Mumbai
Branch
Contact
persons'mobile
number
is
09664XXXXXX
Ms.
We
have
booked
the
car
on
24th
Dec.
12
and
paid
100%
amount
on
27th
December

2012
and
requested
to
get
us
the
Car
RC
dated
January

2013.

Cheque
debited
to
our
account
on
29th
December

Since
that
time
we
are
informed
that
car
will
be
delivered
to
us
with
in
4-5
days

i.e.
latest
by
5th
or
6th
January
as
1st
may
be
a
holiday.
However
after
2nd
January
onwards
some
excuses
are
being
given
and
car
is
yet
to
be
delivered.
We
understand
that
the
process
of
RTO
had
not
been
started
on
2nd
and
that
has
resulted
in
whole
delay.
Some
of
the
forms
had
not
been
obtained
till
2nd
and
we
were
made
to
rush
the
same
on
2nd
Jan.
We
had
requested
at
the
begining
that
we
shall
get
the
car
latest
by
SUNDAY
or
in
any
caseby
Monday
that
is
7th
January

2013.
It
appears
that
either
the
RTO
work
is
being
given
to
an
outsider
and
he
has
delayed
the
process
or
it
is
the
negligence
of
the
person
handling
the
matter.
Now
to
our
surprise
we
are
being
informed
that
Car
number
is
yet
to
be
received
and
is
likely
to
be
received
only
after
6pm
on
8th
January.
So
car
can
not
be
delivered
even
on
Tuesday
8th
January.
We
asked
to
conatct
us
to
the
branch
head
but
no
care
is
being
taken.
We
request
you
to
intervene
and
resolve
the
issue
today
itself.

excellent

very

A
trusted
name
of
Khivraj
and
A
world
class
name
of
Renault
and
deadly
combination.
Experience
like
this

build
the
faith
of
taking
decision
on
the
right
track. 
I
travel
around

day
avg.
And
i
still
feel
fresh.
Just
a
but
noisy

nice.
I
had
done
a
detailed
study

dealers
before
investing
my
monies
on
this

Trust
me

Lanson
Toyota

Kun
Hyundai
and
Khivraj
Renault
have
been
the
best
experience
ever

but
what
really
did
it
in
was
also
a
car
like
scala

which
other
missed
out
having. 
Had
the
worst
experience
with
Nissan
dealers

and
all
Honda
and
VW
dealers.
Will
definitely
be
recommending
Scala

Khivraj
to
buy
this
car
and
enjoy
a
world

experience

about

because
cardekho.com
has

for
providing

services.
you
call
or
write
to
customer
care
of
renault
it
is
handled
by
cardekho
team.
Well
frankly
speaking

forget
about
the
car
.renault
dealers
have
hired
the
worst
people
to
handle
customers.
In
haryana
most
of
the
cities
are
aquired
by
one
man
and
have
the
monopoly.
I
was
literally
abused
by
the
salesman
and
the
sales
head
backed
him.
This
is
pre
sales
position
in
Renault.
I
called
the
renault
customer
care
which
was
handled
by
car
dekhoo
team
but
they
said
 that
they
have
escalted
the
issue
but
no
body
called
me
up.
Worst
company
which
do
not
have
a
customer
care
of
its
own.
Renault
does
not
have
their
own
manufacturing
plant
and
neither
customer
care.
Both
Nissan
and
renault
have
huge
shortage
of
their
parts
as
all
manufactured
in
same
plant.
My
cousin
have
a
nissan
sunny
and
it
took
30
days
to
change
defective
compressor.
Throwing
10
lakhs
to
a
company
which
can
not
even
have
a
customer
care
is
not
advisable.
Renault
india
website
does
not
have
any
phone
numbers
of
their
offices.
In
no
way

you
can
contact
renault
people.
Toll
free
number
is
there
which
doesnot
connect
from
mobiles
and
it
connect
to

Full
Review

This
thing
is
sumthing
new
from
the
Renault
stable.
The
Renault
K9K
engine
gives
some
feeling...
With
a
maximum
output
of
86PS
@
3750
RPM
and
a
whooping
 max
torque
of
200
NM
@2000
RPM.
It
is
around
1470
CC
and
is
certainly
worth
it.
The
electrcic
power
steering
feels
steady
and
shall
make
cars
ride
in
the
traffic
easier
and
certainly
better
on
highways.
The
rear
is
sumthing
that
impressed
me
the
most. The
chrome
lining
on
the
trunk
with
the
name
SCALA
embrossed
is
just
fabulous.
The
smoked
styled
headlamps
add
to
the
design
character
of
the
car

giving
it
a
modernand
energetic
feel.
The

Full
Review

After
going
through
the
big
list
of
sedans
I
finally
narrowed
down
to
Renault's
new
Scala
since
I
always
wanted
to
buy
a
Nissan
Sunny

I
already
had
a
Figo
so
tool
my
own
time
and
the
wait
paid
off.
Scala
is
obviously
a
better
choice
than
Sunny
if
you
dont
mind
those
extra
bucks
that
you
pay
for.
Now
coming
back
to
the
story
of
the
sales
experience
with
dump
ducks
like
Khivraj

I
went
to
the
Anna
Nagar
dealership
to
enquire
on
sales
details
I
was
told
that
Insurance
is
free
along
with
GPS
and
parking
sensors.
I
went
there
in
about
a
week
holding
a
cheque
to
pay
the
advance
-
now
they
tell
me
that
its
only
the
insurance
that
is
free
and
didnt
even
bother
to
apoligize
for
miscommunication

I
stepped
out
and
escalated
it
to
Renault
customer
care
and
within
a
week
they
came
to
my
door
step
to
take
the
booking
but
again
I
have
to
live
with
just
the
Insurance
free
offer.
I
have
to
push
for
delivery
on
my
sons
BDay
and
they
also
agreed
that
I
can
take
delivery
directly
from
the
RTO
office

I
went
there
and
guess
what
-
I
was
able
to
find
11
faults
with
the
brand
new
vehicle

even
basic
things
like
Stepnee

mud
flaps
was
missing
along
with
minor
scratches
on
the
body.
I
spent
my
diwali
and
again
went
on
escalation
-
again
people
came
to
my
door
step
and
picked
up
the
vehicle
for
rectification.
They
delivered
a
dirtly
vehicle
back
this
afternoon
because
of
which
I
writing
this
down.
If
you
are
in
chennai
please
be
aware
that
the
dealership
has
no
access
to
the
vehicle
after
sales
so
how
much
ever
you
yell
at
them
there
is
no
use
-
so
when
you
take
delivery
ensure
you
do
a
through
check
before
you
leave.
I
wanted
to
share
the
pain
I
am
going
through
to
everyone
so
that
instead
of
breaking
our
heads
with
a
bunch
of
jokers
its
better
we
play
it
safe
before
hand
so
never
ever
take
delivery
out
the
door
even
if
a
small
amount
of
disattisfaction.
Otherwise
I
love
the
Scala
and
its
a
pleasure
to
own
it.

Dealers

I
purchased
this

in
aurangabd

I
have
arrange
vehcile
loan
&
balace
cash
payment
in
one
day
but
unfortunately dealer
was
failed
to
give
delivery
on
time
ie
at 3
pm.
He was
giving
excuse
about
diwali
holiday
etc
but
at
the
same
time
just
one
day
before he
was
assured
me
that
he
 will
deliver
the
car
by
3
pm.
Atthe
same
to
senior
manager
was
not
availabe
to
understand
my
problem.
He
was
just
sitting
inside
the
cabin
with
no
reason?
After
delivery
also
the
service
center
techniciain
was
not
aware
about
how
to
fit
foot
strip
in
the

he
tried
his
best
but
lastly
not
suceed.
Reverse

fitting

was
not
available
in
the

 So

Needs
improvement

gets
sudden

company

Renault

monitor
its

customers.

no

I
own
a
Renault
Scala
KL
59
XXXXX

which
I
bought
from
Renault
Kannur
showroom
11
months
back.
Four
months
after
I
bought
the
car
I
noticed
that
the
ac
was
not
working
properly
sometimes
hot
air
was
coming
out
of
the
ac
vent
.So
I
approached
the
Renault
service
centre
at
Kannur
and
after
taking
three
days
for
inspection
we
were
told
that
the
damage
caused
to
the
outer
air
vent
of
the
ac
by
rat
entry
was
the
reason
for
the
ac
malfunction
and
that
it
was
not
covered
under
the
warranty.
The
service
manager
advised
us
to
change
the
blower
at
an
expense
of
Rs
25000
since
according
to
them
it
was
the
only
solution.
Since
I
was
not
convinced
we
decided
to
opt
out
of
their
advise.
But
on
the
evening
after
this
service
I
noticed
foul
smell
coming
out
of
the
ac
and
gave
the
car
for
a
second
service
at
the
same
service
centre.
Taking
three
more
days
and
after
paying
Rs
3000
they
gave
the
car
back
but
foul
smell
still
persisted
and
the
problem
with
ac
remained
the
same.
I
contacted
the
customer
care
centre
but
the
only
reply
we
received
was
to
follow
the
advice
of
service
centre
personnel.
Finally
I
had
the
car
rechecked
by
an
ac
mechanic
and
by
an
hour
he
was
able
to
find
out
that
the
problem
was
that
shutter
of
the
heater
was
jammed
in
the
open
position
and
he
was
able
to
correct
it
in
no
time
with
Rs
300
as
the
service
charge.
Such
a
simple
problem
could
not
be
detected
by
the
service
personnel
even
after
two
services
taking
six
days.
I
am
very
much
disappointed
with
the
after
sale
service
provided
by
Renault
and
I
will
never
recommend
this
brand
to
anyone
eventhough
in
other
aspects
the
car
functions
satisfactorily.

Ride

Smooth
car.
But
safety
features
are
totally
bad.
I
had
a
bad
car
accident
when
I
tried
to
avoid
an
animal
on
the
highway
by
steering
slightly
to
the
left
and
trying
to
apply
brakes.
Car
skidded
to
the
right

rear
end
came
to
front
direction

car
moved
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
over
turned
in
the
small
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road.
It
was
a
narrow
escape
for
me
and
my
friends.
Everybody
were
saved
just
because
even
the
back
seat
riders
were
wearing
seat
belts.
The
road
was
flat

no
pot
holes

no
oil

no
rain
-
with
all
these
perfect
conditions
also
my
car
skidded.
When
compared
to
hatchback
cars

you
can
feel
the
drag
at
the
back
when
you
want
to
turn
in
hilly
roads
and
i
guess
the
weight
distribution
of
the
car
is
not
correct

which
caused
the
skid
in
my
case.
I
had
driven
other
cars
where
i
was
able
to
steer
clear
of
these
kinds
of
obstacles
and
ride
safely

even
on
snowy
surfaces
at
US.
Another
point

Airbags
did
not
deploy
even
after
rollever.
Company
says
it
will
deploy
only
on
frontal
impacts.
However

in
my
case
the
car
had
impacts
to
sides
of
front
of
the
car

the
gaurd
ripped
off
-
still
no
airbag
deployed!!!
If
you
are
thinking
of
going
for
this
car
thinking
it
looks
good
and
has
safety
features
like
ABS
with
EBD

and
at
highway
speeds
you
can
avoid
something

it
will
be
a
wrong
assumption. 
Final
Words
For
safety
reasons
do
not
go
for
this
car.
or
if
you
want
to
drive
at
a
very
low
speed
of
under
60
on
highways

you
may
go
for
this
car.

Exterior
The
new
Ford
Fiesta
2014
with
the
Austin
Martin
front
grill
has
the
looks
of
a
show
stopper.
It
does
turn
quite
a
few
heads
on
the
roads.
I've
test
driven
every
car
in
this
in
this
segment
i.e.
Rapid

Vento

Linea

Sunny

and
the
Honda
City

This

2nd

lived
the

trim
of
the

and
also
the
interior

Then
I
test
drove
the
Fiesta.
It

quite
up

and

that
is
unmatched
in
it

The

of
your
phone
is
unparalleled.
I
think
a
special
mention
about
the
music
system
is
befitting.
It
has
incredibly
crisp
and
audibly
loud

no

The
rear
seating
is
a
bit

is

it
snugs
to

Engine
performance
is
good.
However

It
lags
a
bit
below
1500
rpm
hence
for
city
drive
we
might
feel
lil
gloomy

once
you
are
used-to
it
there
will
be
no

.
But
for
highway
drive
definitely
this
is
the
king
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
For
this
weight
and
size
at
least
1.6
liter
diesel
engine
is
a
really
must
one.
So
this
might
be
a
negative.
But
can
be
manageable.
But

if

FIAT
should
have
done
this

none
of
the
same
segment
cars
will
come
near
to
this

that
you

looks
but
yes
gives
a
mix
of
classic

modern
looks.The

is
very
comfortable
and
this

is
among
the
forty
cars
I
drove
before
buying
which
has
both
driver's

equal
comfort.
As
I
said
you
do
get
a

at
the
roof
when
you
get
inside
and
from
the

used
you
will
be
able
to
judge
difference

initial

post
that
its
a
fun
to
drive
vehicle.
Have
minimal
noise
inside
the

does
give
a
very
smooth

was
21km/l

14km/l

22km.

rubbery

smooth.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling The
best
drive
for
Fiat
is
on
the
open
roads
and
it
is
a
very
comfortable
car
to
drive.
I
havent
had
the
luxury
of
sitting
at
the
back
but
on
the
feedback
has
been
good
for
pillion
riders.A
small
point
to
add
is
that
Linea
is
an
easier
car
to
get
in
and
get
out
of
it
and
it
is
an
important
features
especially
for
the
elders.
 
Final
Words I
would
say
if
people
are
out
there
to
decide
to
buy
a
goof
product
and
dont
go
out
to
buy
just
the
brands
Fiat
will
offer
them
a
surprise
as
was
evident
with
my
collegues
who
bought
other
brands
in
this
segment.
Areas
of
improvement Definately
require
more
service
centres.Still
need
to
expereince
their
service
levels.

still
one

have
now
owned
the
car
for
3.5
years

>70k
km

 and
enjoyed
it.
Being
a
diesel
it
is
a
little
heavy
but
once
in
4th
gear
it
can
be
a
beast.
Mileage
with
AC
in
summers
in
about
12
kmpl
and
in
winters
about
14
kmpl.
The

still
drives
as

as

taken
it

accept

I
have
no

guess

but
not
the
dealers.
Areas
of
improvement  FIAT
Cars
are
really
good
but
dealers
should
be
more
aggresive
to
bring
out
the
product.
Absoultely
Sales
Head
is
not
at
all
bothered

Why
should
he?
as
long
as
he
is
paid
like
a
govt
job???

about
the
customers
visiting
the
showroom

he
didnt
even
leaves
his
chair
and
comes
to
the
customer
to
explain
about
the
car.
We
should
look
at
the
cars
ourselves
like
orphans.
This
should
change
due
these
kind
heartless
people
Fiat
is
loosing
its
market
in
India.
The
attitude
of
the
Sales
Manager
is
very
pathetic
and
not
customer
friendly

recently
i
booked
a
Fiat
Linea.
The
sales
manager
till
getting
the
advance
from
me
he
was
calling
the
whole
day.
After
that
he
never
called
me
rather
he
rejected
my
calls.
However
I
continued
to
go
ahead
and
book
the
car
ONLY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SALES
EXECUTIVE
Mr.
RAHUL
due
to
his
very
friendly
approach.
I
dont
know
who
is
managing
the
delearship
Must
meet
them.
Plz
share
the
contact
of
the
MD
of
Ramkay

tried
max

no

It
just
do

you

heard
tyre
noise

but
handling...cool....I
got
2011
model
with
less
ground
clearance

but
Fiat
offered
the
option
to
increase
the
ground
clearance.
Haven't
found
any
big
difference.
So
far

only
big
change

changed
all

Otherwise
everything

people
advised
not
to
go
for

I
took
the
chance.
No
regret
at
all.
Infact

after
I
drove

I
feel

better
that
I
didn't
make
any

I
have

25000

everytime
I
drive

I
feel

this
vehicle...Very
good
brakes


nice
input
from

makes
it
a

in

all
cars
do
this
vehicle
has
some
cons
too..Like
the
ground
clearence..But
do
u
think
Indian
roads
are
good
for
any
foreign
sedans?
Infact
Indian
roads
are
buit
for
Trucks
bullock
carts
and
cheap
Tata
vehicles

not
much
difference
between
Road
speed
brakers
and
mountains
in
south
india
though
.
Sunny
is
purely
built
for
good
express
highways..If u
are
frequent
traveller
in
village
roads
then
Nissan
Torrano
is
the
good
choice..Sunny
is
a
no
nonsense
full
paisa
vasool
vehicle...you
definetly
get
more
than
you
paid
for
plus
peace
of
mind..Their
dealership
has
improved
phenomenally..the
quality
of
the
vehicle
is
extremly
good..the
cabin
noice
is
a
little
bit
high
at
higher
RPMs

130
kms
plus
..But
then
I
never
got
a
chance
to
drive
anything
more
than
130
kms

well
again
you
know
Indian
Trucks
on
highways
driving
all
around
you
taking
their

..This
vehicle
promised
to
give

21
and
its
giving
20.06
km
highways
at
100
kms
and
city
17..
many
times
I
forget
to
fill
its
diesel
tank
..Plus
not
so
costly
dealership
and
service
costs
makes
me
love
this
vehicle.To
conclude:
If
you
are
looking
for
a
spacious
comfortable

highway

Luxurious
Sedan
and
which
can
suit

compared

with

of

space

infact
you
can
sleep
inside

this
vehicle
is
for
you.
If
you
frequently
drive
more
in

then

is
the
best
choice. Buy

Thankfully
because
of
a
highway

there
wasn't

might

was
fortunate
that
the

it
could

for
any
possibility
of
hitting
of
any
objects
but
couldn’t
find
any
such
thing.
I
immediately
took
my
car
to
local
dealer
in
Sonipat

.
who
in
turn
sent
the

for

also
told
me
that
there

better

than

in

of
similar

Most

the

of

is
much
reliable.
Its

expensive

reliable.
If

should

Full
Review

The
car
is
good
in
look-and-feel

however
there
is
a
serious
disregard
to
the
customer
safety

and
in
my
experience
Honda's
post
buy
customer
service
is
poor
at
best.
My
Honda
City
is
just
6
months
old

and
has
been
driven
3800
kms
so
far.
I
have
just
had
2
long

>
100
kms

trips
with
it.
During
my
second
trip

one
of
the
tyres
was
burst
while
I
was
actually
driving
the
car
at
80
kmph

luckily
we
were
unscathed


and
I
also
saw
that
the
other
tyre
in
the
front
had
a
huge
bulge
developed
in
it. 
Upon
following
up
with
Honda
about
the
issue

we
were
left
with
dealing
with
Goodyear
directly.
Only
when
a
Goodyear
engineer
comes
to
the
showroom

once
a
month


I
had
to
bring
my
car
there. Goodyear
flatly
denied
having
any
manufacturing
defects
with
the
tyre.
According
to
them

this
has
happened
due
to
bad
road
condition

I
was
driving
from
Ahmedabad
to
Udaipur

the
roads
are
really
nice

actually


and
it
must
have
hit
a
huge
hole.
The
entire
experience
is
harrowing

and
there
was
no
concern
shown
by
Honda
and
GoodYear.
Upon
third
party
reviews

I
found
that
the
Goodyear
tyres
that
come
with
Honda
are
of
the
most
inferior
quality.
So

basically

in
order
to
get
better
looks
and
getting
a
cheaper
model
out
of
the
door

Honda
is
playing
with
customer
safety!!
My
finish
line
is
:
Buy
only
if
you
don't
care
about
your
life

and
if
you
want
to
buy
it
neverthless
--
for
God's
sake

spend
extra
25000
more
and
get
better
tyres
before
you
drive
it
out
of
the
showroom!

Very

though
not
that
significant
finctunally

add

Cuts

creases
at
right
locations.
A
good
musculine
touch
to
the
overall
appearance.
In
short

this
car
is
quite
a
head
turner
as
compared
to
the
competition
in
its
segment.
Body
metal
sheets
could
have
been
a
bit
more
sturdy..at
present
they
seem
to
be
a
bit
weak.

Its
great
that
the
bump
on
the
rear
footboard
minimal
and
hence
makes
the

quite
comfortable

very
well

Though

the

looks
premium

but
its
make
even
a
slight
of
dust
or
fingure
print
marks
distinctly
visible
and
has
to
be
cleaned
very
often.
The
worst
fear
is
that
it
is
prone
to
some
scratches
over
longer
usage.
Hope
that
honda
team
has
the
right
solutions
for
the
scratches.

..But
the
vibrations
are
noticable
at

the
strange
fact
is
that
the
vibrations

is
not
constant.
They
errupt
out

no

last
for

The
car
may
not
be
ideal
for
the

but
it
performs
greatly
at

Gear
Box
is

is

lavish
sitting
style
in
a
mid

is
the
beauty
of
the
car.
However

if
we
look
into
space
for
keeping
material
inside

we
get
confused.
I
had
rear
screen

two
pillows
and
one
tissue
paper
box
to
be
kept
in
the
rear. I
could
not
find
space
for
these
items.
the
glass

rear
wind
screen
 is
so
much
tilted
that
in
case
you
put
the
screen

you
can't
keep
the
pillows.
And
adjusting
tissue
paper
box
in
between
the
pillows
is
again
a
herculean
task.
You
have
to
put
a
wellcrow
tape
to
fix
the
box

and
the
best
part
is
that
the
dealer
presents
you
with
a
tissue
paper
box
when
you
purchase
the
car.
Engine

Fuel
Economy

Engine
performance
is
good
for
fuel
economy. I
have
done
2000+
kms
till
now
and
was
able
to
get
22+
milage
on
Highway

80%
/city
conditions.
Gearbox
is
noisy.
It
creates
a
big
sound
while
changover.
The
engine
is
quite
noisy.
It
equals
my
earlier
6
year
old
Logan
at
this
point
itself.
Don't
know
what
will
happen
later.
Yes
one
thing
the
car
has
started
smoothening
after
running
for
this
distance.
Car's
system
had
malfunctioned
last
time
when
I
had
moved
out
of
city.
I
was
not
able
to
get
proper
assistance
in
city
away
from
NCR.
Though
the
problem
disappeared
after
a
day

yet
I
was
told
to
get
the
system
scanned
when
back
in
town.
To
my
amazement
the
scanning
system
at
dealer
end
was
found
defective
last
Saturday
when
I
visited
him.
Have
to
see
when
it
will
get
repaired
and
they
will
recall
my
vehicle
to
attend.
Else
will
have
to
raise
the
issue
as
it
may
give
issues
to
my
car
later.

On

you
will
find
it
dull

2nd

the

The
car
has
improved
in
all
areas
from
the
2nd
gen
car. 
Very
unlike
Honda

I
am
experiencing
some
teeething
troubles
with
the
car.
There
is
a
rattle
in
the
dash
board
wich
could
not
be
rectified
by
the
dealer.
The
auto
door
lock
sensor
goes
crazy
sometimes
and
keep
locking/unlocking
the
car
over
rough
roads
and
bumps.
I
am
among
the
first
few
owners
when
it
was
launched
and
this
could
explain
the
teething
troubles.
The
centre
arm
rest
is
not
mush
use
and
a
slider
versions


like
the
civic


would
be
useful.
Seat
Back
pockets
are
sorely
missed
in
the
V
grade.
16"
rims

185

be

and
look

a

astonishing.
Front
grill
has
been
changed
from
3
segment
grill
to
a
broad
single
piece
grill.
Styling
as
well
as
finishing of
front
grill
is
not
as
good
as
it
was
in
previous
version.
This
is
the
area
which
i
think have
a
great
scope
of
improvement.

 Fuel
Economy
is
good.
Got
mileage
of
22
Km/l
on
highway
driving
at
a
speed
of
80-100
Kmph.To
avoid
knocking
when
accelerator
pedal
is
released

Honda
has
set
sort
of
cruise
speed
for
each
gear

this
might
be
what
they
call
i-dtec/i-vtec
.
for
novice
it
could
be
a
good
option
but
for
regular
user
this
is
bit
annoying
as
speed
dont
reduce
beyond
certain
limit
on
releasing
accelerator
pedal.
Can
feel
engine
noice
inside
the
car
but
as
I
understand
it
is
inherent
property
of
diesel
engine.

been
made
stiffer
compared
to

to
avoid
car
hitting
bumps
on
the
road.
this
has
reduced
comfort
little
bit
but
still
is
very
much
acceptable.
Steering
wheel
is
bit
more
smooth
to
give
feel
of
a
sturdy
car.
I
am
not
more
of
a
cruiser
so
wont
be
able
to
write
more
about

Honda
has
finally
given
in
to
the
country’s
demand
for
a
diesel
engine.
It’s
also
packed
this
latest
iteration
with
a
tonne
of
features
–
something
we
Indians
love.
The

may
have
missed
the
sweet
spot
when
it
comes
to
timing

but
it
definitely
beats
not
turning
up
at
all.
So
how
good
is
the
new
‘consumer-oriented’
City?
We
thoroughly
tested
both

the
petrol
and
the
diesel
manuals

to
see
if
it
sets
new
benchmarks

Everybody
knows
its
complete
aerodynamic
shape
makes
it
more
attractive
and
beautiful
car
available
in
market.
The
features
which
I
like
the
most
is
rear
end
of
car
and
shark
fin
antenna...takes
the
car
to
upper
level.
 Addition
to
this
I
would
like
mention
here
is
that
this
is
the
first
car
which
has
got
engine
under
body
tray. 
Interior

Features

Space
&
Comfort

Interiors
are
excellent.
The
moment
you
get
into
the
car
you
will
feel
the
quality
difference
of
dashboar
plastics

door
trim

seats

every
this
is
made
up
of
top
quality
material.
Talking
more
about
the
features
the
blue
multi
informational
display
is
very
good
and
provide
sufficient
required
information
at
all
time.
The
feature
which
delights
me
a
lot
is
touch
screen
automatic
climate
control
system.
Space
and
Comfort:-
Ha
Ha
Ha
second
row
seat
is
place
where
actually
you
should
be.
Sufficient
leg
room
and
head
room.
just
pull
down
the
arm-rest
and
enjoy
the
ride
in
very
relaxed
mode.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox
Hmmmm...
Here
comes
bit
of
disappointment.
I
found
acceleration
is
the
area
where
car
is
lacking
behind

I
am
talking
about
only
diesel
engine
car
only

otherwise
everything
is
just
perfect.
Smooth
diesel
engine.
Very
good
fuel
economy.
I
am
getting
21-22
Kmpl
in
city
and
on
highway
its
23-24
kmpl

these
values
are
from
MID

Gearbox
is
smooth
and
easy
to
shift
the
gears.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling
NVH
levels
are
reduced
significantly
as
compared
to
Amaze.
But
yes
you
will
get
the
feel
always
that
under
the
hood
there
is
diesel
engine
is
there.
Improved
GC
makes
the
car
to
cross
the
speed
bakers
with
ease.
Suspension
is
very
good.
At
low
speed
or
even
at
high
speeds
the
car
just
glides
over
the
pot-holes.
Handling:
-
it’s
just
perfect.
Smooth
and
light
steering
gives
you
much
more
confidence
on
higher
speeds
as
well

even
above
100
kmph.
Final
Words
If
you
are
looking
for
smooth

steady
drive
with
comfort
then
go
for
SV
Diesel
and
if
you
want
to
have
some
fun
on
highways
then
don’t
you
dare
to
look
at
diesel
version
because
petrol.
It’s
simply
the
best. 
Areas
of
improvement
Basic
feature
like
'Map

should
be
provided
for
all
variants.

Gearbox
is
too
hard.
Bluetooth
mic
doesn't
work
and
showroom
says
you
need
to
speak
at

person
to
hear
your

Ride
Quality
&

Pick
up
is
not
as
good.
For
example

 If
the
speed
reduces
to
40KMPH
in
traffic
and
you
are
running
in
5th

even
4thgear

car
will
not

until
you
bring
down
the
gear
to

I
did
not
realise
it
in
test
drive
and
pickup
seem
OK
but
realised
it
while
driving
in
daily
traffic
conditions.
Final
Words
I
have
bought
the
SV
model
just
20
days
back
and
realised
these
issue.
Mainly
the
bluetooth
mic
located
in
the
stereo
body
due
to
which
your
voice
is
not
clear
and
too
low
for
the
hearing
party.
 When
i
spoke
with
dealer
i
got
to
know
that
the
test
drive
was
given
in
V

where
the
mic
is
in
roof.
The
dealer
changed
the
stereo
twice
and
now
its
been
changed
by
the
sterio
vendor
but
problem
remains
the
same.
Its
a
basic
feature
which
doesn't
work
and
Honda
doesn't
take
responsibility
of
improper
information
and
poor
qaulity
even
when
multiple
issue
have
been
raised
since
2014.

Final
Words I
bought
a
New
Vento
in
Aug'2015.Within
2
months
of
use
the
wheels
and
some
inner
parts
started
rusting
and
I
reported
this
matter
to
the
dealer
KTC
Cochin.I
was
surprised
with
their
response
as
they
said
it's
common
in
VW
cars
and
nothing
to
worry.But
when
I
insisted
on
solution
they
said
they
want
to
consult
with
the
company
and
they
need
the
vehicle
in
their
custody
for
2-3
days
to
discuss
with
their
plant..This
is
again
shocking
as
they
don't
care
about
the
inconvenience
to
the
customer
by
keeping
the
vehicle
in
their
custody
just
for
the
discussion
with
their
plant.They
said
plant
will
ask
lot
of
quieries
and
they
want
the
vehicle
to
be
in
their
workshop
till
the
discussion
is
over..Why
the
customer
has
to
suffer
for
their
inefficiency
which
I
don't
understand..Also
the
mileage
is
very
poor.The
company
offers
20.64
but
getting
nearly
12
to
13
in
city
and
16

infact
I
had
faced
an
unfair
trade
practise
from
the
dealer.After
lot
of

ups
I
got
the
refund
of
excess
money
collected
by
the

Exterior The
car
looked
great. 
My
children
and
I
preferred
Metallic
Grey
as
we
felt
the
car
looked
like
a
robot
in
that
colour. 
I
saw
many
people
turn
their
heads
to
our
direction
whenever
we
drove.

 The
seats
looked
great
when
I saw
the
through
car
from
outside. 
The
seats
are
very
spacious. 
My
son
was
very
happpy because
he
could
sit
comfortably
for
longer
time
over
a
long
distance. 
He
used
to
complain
earlier
when
we
had
driven
a smaller hatchback.  My
daughter
was
in
big
smile
when
she
travelled longer
distance
because
there
was
no
travel
fatigue. 
In
summary

the
quality
of
journey
or
comfort
in
Toyato
Corolla has
been Impeccable.
Engine
Performance

Fuel
Economy
and
Gearbox I
bought
a
new
Diesel
Corolla
Altis

Model: 
D-4D
JS

in
June
2015.
In
fact

I
had
booked
for
a
Jetta
Comfortline
Diesel
with
a
waiting
time
of
2
months;
but
after
the
waiting
time

Jetta
dealer
said
that
I
had
to
wait
for
another
8
months!!  
Though
disappointed

I
spent
two
days
to
find
an
alternative
to
Jetta.  
I
narrowed
my
choice
to
Toyota
Corolla.
So

I
called
Annamalais
Toyota
located
in
Karur
Dt

Tamil
Nadu
immediately 
and
expressed
my
tentative
interest.
 To
my
surprise

the
Toyota
Representatives
brought
a
Corolla
Diesel
same
day
evening
to
my
residence
at
Manapparai
for
a
test
drive.
I
tested
this
car
on
a
40
km
stretch
of
Trichy
-
Manapparai
Highway.
My 
initial
impression
about
engine
performance
was
that
the
car
was
very
comfortable
in
the
speed
range
100
-
130
kmph
with
good
stability.
I
also
drove
the
car
in
lower
speeds
at
40
kmph. 
My
conclusion
was
that
it
was
a
practical
car
meeting
my
requirements. 
Toyota
Representatives
assured
that
the
expected
mileage
would
be
about
20
kmpl.
Since
I
normally
drive
in
the
range
100
-
120
kmph
range
and
since
I
felt
the
car
was
practical
I
decided
to
buy
the
Toyota
Corolla
Altis.
Needless
to
say
the
positive
role
played
by
Toyota
Representatives
also
helped
a
lot
to
decide
in
favor
of
Toyota.
In
the
first
two
2
months

I
drove 
my
Toyota
Corolla
Altis
car
for
about
2500
km.
I
was
driving
at
a
speed
of
30
-
40
kmph
locally
and
at
a
speed
of
100
-
120
kmph
on
highways.
The
car
was
slightly
sluggish
in
the
top
gear
when
I
wanted
to
race
from
80
kmph
to
100
kmph
in
the
sixth
gear
and
the
car
was
clicking
a
mileage
of
about
18.4
kmpl.
However

the
performance
of
the
car
began
to
improve 
once
I
crossed
5000
km
in
my
odometer.
Meanwhile

I
also
understood
the
car
better
and
began
to
shift
the
gear
appropriately
to
the
required
speed.
Since
then

the
car
has
been
an
absolute
delight
to
drive.
The
car
was 
responding
much
better

after
crossing
5000
km

and
pickup
from 
80
kmph
to
120
km
was
effortless
in
the
same
sixth
gear.
Now
the
car
has
been
clocking
23.5
kmpl
on
highways
and
18.5
on
local
roads
thus
giving
20.4
kmpl
cumulative. 
Once
I
competed
with
Jetta
TDI
on
a
Highway
and
I
found
my
Corolla
Diesel
was responding
with
a
speed
of
140
kmph
giving
a
mileage
of
18
kmpl;
I
was
shifting
between
4th
and
5th
gear.
In
Nov
2015

during
my
recent
Diwali
 trip
from
Manapparai

Trichy
District
to
Salem

the
car
was
loaded
75%
full
with
the
occupancy
of
4
persons

including
the
driver

the
car
ran
in
rainy
weather
with
a
speed
of
110-120
kmph.
The
car
clicked
a
mileage
of
21
kmpl.
The
return
trip
from
Salem
to
Manapparai
 was
in
the
morning
hours
with
two
persons
and
there
was
no
 rain
this
time.
I
maintained
a
speed
of
80-90
kmph.
The
car
clicked
28.1
kmpl
for
a
distance
of
100
km
up
to
Karur.

Unable
to
paste
the
picture
that
recorded
28.1
kmpl
. 
When
I
reached
Manapparai

after
completing
about
190
km

the
car
clicked
a
mileage
of
25.6
kmpl

which
I
consider
extremely
good.
The
odometer
reading
was
about
7000
km.
Ride
Quality
&
Handling Ride
Quality
is
impeccable
as
I
have
very
less
drive
fatigue
over
long
distance
travelling.
Final
Words A luxurious
car
with
good
mileage. 
The
car
can
give
respectable
pick-up
in
the
4th
and
5th
gear
as
well
as
good
mileage
in
the
6th
gear.
Areas
of
improvement The
Steering 
of
Corolla
is
not
as
responsive
as
Jetta.
There
is
lot
of
scope
to
improve
in
this
area
particularly
at
low
speed

30
-
40
kmph.
When
I
take
the
car
for
10000
km
service
 
I
hope
this
problem willbe
addressed
by
Toyota
Engineers.

Bought
a
2015
Audi
A3
a
little
over
a
month
ago.
Great
car

but
having
problems
with
the
navigation
MMI
already.
Tells
me
that
the
car
is
somewhere
I
am
not

and
doesn't
catch
the
speed
traps
which
all
other
Audi's
do
here
in
Korea.
Took
it
to
AUDI
KOREA
service
center
twice
and
they
can't
figure
it
out.
Basically
told
me
I
am
out
of
luck.
This
is
of
course
AFTER
taking
my
car
our
for
a
44
km
joy
ride
and
unplugging
the
black
box
so
there
would
be
no
evidence

expect
for
my
empty
gas
tank
.
I
just
hope
Audi
Headquarters
finds
a
solution
to
fix
the
MMI
because
the
AUDI
KOREA
dealership
and
service
center
are
incompetent
and
horrible.
Please
hire
employees
that
know
how
to
fix
their
own
products
they
represent.
Audi's
brand
is
being
tainted
and
definitely
will
not
be
having
repeat
customers.
Will
NEVER
recommend
an
Audi
to
anyone
in
Korea.
Just
horrible
customer
experience
and
there
are
long
blogs
with
complaints
from
Audi
owners.
Should
have
read
the
blogs
before
buying.

Bought
an
Audi
A3
-
2.0
TDI
Attraction
from
Audi
Bhopal
4
months
back.
While
the
price
on
road
was
quoted
as
28.5
lakhs
in
websites
I
was
shown
a
paper
in
showroom
stating
that
it
costs
30
lakhs.
Not
knowing
that
I
have
to
bargain
like
in
a
fish
market
I
asked
for
a
discount
&
was
told
that
I
will
be
given
a
1
lakh
discount
plus
additional
50
000
less
for
doctor's.
But
only
after
buying
did
I
know
that
the
showroom
was
selling
it
for
around
24
-
25
lakhs
only.
The
sales
executive
hardly
knew
anything
about
the
specifications
of
the
car
&
while
I
insisted
that
I
want
Michelin
tyres
he
said
he
will
try
for
it
but
promised
me
that
the
car
will
come
with
either
Michelin

Bridgestone
or
Continental
tyres
but
was
delivered
with
Dunlop
tyres
which
gets
punctured
or
in
fact
gets
torn
in
every
pothole.
After
a
lot
of
struggle
with
them
changed
it
to
Continental
Premium
Contact
5
but
this
also
gets
torn
with
stones
&
potholes
frequently.
To
change
the
torn
tyres
I
have
to
take
it
to
Indore
200
kms
from
Bhopal
&
stay
there
overnight
since
the
company
executive
is
only
interested
in
closing
down
the
shop
sharp
at
7:30
PM
while
the
technician
who
has
to
change
it
is
not
available
for
the
second
half
of
the
working
monday.
And
they
say
in
Audi
authorised
service
centre
that
they
have
no
facilities
to
repair
the
puncture
but
will
have
to
change
the
tyre
only.
With
all
this
excellent
so
called
service
I
would
be
charged
Rs.
19470
for
1
tyre
while
it
costs
only
Rs.
8500
outside.
In
fact
I
changed
both
front
tyres
to
Michelin
for
Rs.
9
600
each
plus
Rs.
400
for
wheel
balancing
while
the
Audi
service
centre
charges
Rs.
5
800
for
wheel
balancing
alone.
I
failed
to
understand
the
logic
or
maths
involved
in
those
calculations.

Hi
Team
Jaguar

It
is
very
very
disappointing
to
know
that
my
dealing
with
a
 brand
like
Jaguar
ended
up
like
this.
I
had
booked
a
Jaguar
XF
on
the
17th
October'2014
which
was
scheduled
for
delivery
on
the
21st
October'2014.
21st
October'2014
being
Dhanteras
is
a
very
auspicious
day

so
i
really
wanted
to
buy
the
car
on
the
same
day.
A
5
PM
delivery
was
committed
to
me
for
the
same.
I
got
a
call
from
the
showroom
at
about
4.30
PM
saying
that
there
is
some
problem
with
the
PDI
at
the
warehouse
at
Khandsa

Gurgaon
so
the
delivery
will
take
some
time
and
now
the
delivery
was
re-scheduled
at
6-7
pm.
At
7
pm
i
get
telling
me
that
the
car
delivery
isn't
possible
today
as
there
is
some
problem
with
the
server.
I
was
then
committed
the
delivery
the
next
day
i.e.
22nd
October'14
at
3.00
PM.
Before
3
PM
i
got
4-5
calls
from
the
showroom
saying
that
the
car
is
ready
for
delivery
and
they
were
waiting
for
me
to
come
and
pick
it
up.
I
requested
my
family
to
postpone
all
there
plans
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
come
with
me
to
collect
the
car.
We
reached
the
showroom
at
 4
PM
with
my
family
to
take
the
delivery
of
the
Jaguar
XF.
They
asked
me
to
wait
for
10-15
and
in
the
meanwhile
they
asked
me
to
inspect
the
car
which
was
parked
outside
the
showroom
for
delivery.
I
inspected
the
car
and
everything
seemed
to
be
fine.
I
was
asked
to
wait
for
another
15-20
mins
after
that.
After
40-45
mins
they
told
me
that
its
gonna
take
sometime
as
there
was
some
problem
with
the
billing.
I
then
asked
my
family
to
go
back
home
and
told
them
that
i
will
call
them
once
the
papers
are
ready.
I
was
made
to
wait
for
another
2
hours
and
at
about
7.30
they
tell
me
that
they
cant
give
the
car
to
me
today
aswell.
I
was
furious
and
higly
disappointed.
None
of
the
managers
had
the
basic
courtesy
to
even
come
to
me
and
tell
me
as
to
what
the
problem
was.
When
i
called
for
the
manager
i
was
told
that
none
of
them
are
available.
I
was
then
made
to
speak
with
a
manager
on
the
phone
whom
i
asked
to
cancel
my
booking
for
the
car.
He
pressurized
me
alot
and
then
confirmed
me
the
delivery
on
Diwali
i.e.
23rd

October'14.
The
next
day
the
guy
called
me
up
and
again
told
me
the
same
thing
-
"Sir

I
cannot
give
you
the
car
today
as
well
as
 we
are
not
getting
any
approval".
 I
am
really
disappointed
with
the
way
things
have
gone
the
last
week.
Is
this
the
way
a
brand
like
Jaguar
is
suppose
to
function?
Buying
a
freaking
Tata
Nano
would
have
been
better
i
guess.
The
company
should
shut
down
the
showrooms
and
get
into
something
which
they
can
deliver
and
do
something
which
is
of
its
caliber.
Kindly
note
please
dont
experiment
with
markets
you
cannot
cater
to.
Also
note-
the
luxury
market
is
beyond
you!!
you
are
better
off
selling
of
Tata
Nano's
than
Jaguars
and
Range
Rovers.
The
brand
is
highly
incompetent.
Thank
you
for
screwing
my
Diwali.
Thanks

Karan.
