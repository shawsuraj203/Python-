Exterior Excellent,owsome looks, turns heads at the signals with royal color, rear view is fantastic and great designed tail lamps gives good image.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Excellent space and leg room, boot space is very good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I bought a new car so I hv not yet paid for maintaining it, bt till now it looks to b affordable in all aspects, it is giving me mileage of 18 on highways with ac on and 14 in city( although it is difficult to measure mileage in city I hv done it specifically by empting tank n filling just 1 litre and driving in the city.
Ride Quality & Handling Its ok, good one, little roughness in 2 nd gear.
Final Words Value for money for middle class, for first timer in sedan class it is the choice.
Areas of improvement Interiors mainly dashboard, and some changes in steering is needed, and plastic quality used inside needs to be finer.

Exterior Exterior is good. side mirrors contains indicator lamps.the car's ultimate looks never truly speaks out that what is its original price.the head lamps and tail lamps are funky and trendy.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Leg space is good,it has comfortable seats. The cd player is good,but interior more or less backdated and cant really match with the quality of the exterior. Power windows is present in this version.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox No idea of the fuel economy, engine performance. please comment on the fuel economy of the car in the city as well as in the highway.
Ride Quality & Handling No idea about thee riding quality and handling.
Final Words Finally it can b said that it is worth buying, I mean 2 say that its true value to ur money.but if the engine quality specially the petrol variants and the interiors are developed,then the tata indigo could b one of the black horses in the section of mid sized sedans.
Areas of improvement Heard that the pickup is of very poor grade, sedans, specially the mid sized ones should have a little more pick up and boast of a better class engine than the hatchbacks. else y people would go for a sedan wen his purposes are satisfied by a hatchback.

Exterior Decent looking sedan with good ground clearance.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Extremely spacious; as far as I've seen most other cars in this category are at best cramped inside. Good comfortable seats for long rides as well as stop & go city traffic.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Decent fuel ecomony. I get an average of about 14kmpl (petrol) and mostly drive around in the city. Stop & go traffic causes economy to go down by at worst 2 kmpl in my observation.
Pickup is decent however there is a lag and you have to downshift to reduce spooling time and get better response.
Ride Quality & Handling Good firm handling at high speeds & stable in curves/bends. I have driven about 20 thou ks most of which has been on rough roads and still get the feeling of gliding on the road; well mostly.
Final Words Worth every paise. Better looking on the outside and extremely spacious inside than most hatchbacks which I found are most often than not cramped and claustrophobic. A true family car.
Areas of improvement Can improve by addition of safety features like airbags etc.

Exterior Good exteriors - sedan look.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very Spacious & comfortable seating.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Pick up is not so good. I bought the car 6 months back from Wasan Motors, one of the WORST DEALERS. Poor after sales service, Bad fuel economy... gives a mileage of 8Kmpl in city with AC. With the rising fuel prices, not a good bargain. Only the name TATA is good, not the car.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is OK, rather quite good, except the pick up. Also it is tough to drive beyond a speed of 90 on highway.
Final Words I made a mistake to buy this car - shall try to sell it off & NEVER EVER BUY A TATA CAR.
Areas of improvement They should concentrate on the working of the car more than the looks. They should improve the engine to give a better mileage. Also they should have the practice to supervise their dealers.

Exterior Very nice exterior with adjustable blinked slide glass,foag lamps.Over all extenrior will attact the customer.

Leg space is very nice,front & back seats are well designed for comfort.Overall suspension is good but need to improve for handelling,chances of tire wornout before the expiry date
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine perfornce is good,but vibrations are more,need to improve the foundation rubber quality.
Fuel economy is compared to other diesel vehicle is good

Ride Quality & Handling Ride is good but handelling quality need improvemnet
Final Words  Good car with low cost.You will get value for money for the car.over all Not Good not bad.
Areas of improvement Service quality needs to improverd to gain customer satistfaction,Need to improve on plastic quality & also required to take permenant actions on repeated complaints like,slide window not working,high emmision,belt noise....etc

Hyundai's Fluidic Concept is really god but not very well reflected in Xcent


Full Review 
Exterior The Car comes with good exteriors though Hyundai could have given a slight upward lift to the back to make it look more appealing.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are so compelling that you cannot resist buying one for you. Frankly, no car (sedan) would come at such a low cost with Rear AC vents, Rear Parking Sensor, Rear Power Windows and with a company fitted music system with Steering Mounted Controls, Bluetooth Connectivity etc. A must buy in terms of interiors. The cabin is so silent that you cannot even hear the sound of your own horn inside (on an extremely busy road).
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 1.2 ltr pertol is the same Kappa used in i10 and now Grand i10. Gives 12-14 kmph in city and 18-19 on highways, Gear Shift is extremely smooth. And gear shift patern is different in Diesel variant.
Ride Quality & Handling Perfect ten for ride quality (in city).
Final Words If you are going for hatchback in this budget and love to own a sedan, Xcent is the perfect choice.
Areas of improvement Looks could have been more appealing like that of Verna & Elantra had fluidic concept been incorporated more creatively.

Full Review 
I had multiple test drives and booked SX (O). However, there is delay in delivery without any prediction. I was confirmed for delivery for 4-6 weeks in Apr. And now dealer is saying no date can be commited. So, beware of dealers and ready for delays. Go for very small 5-7k booking amount and get cancellation refund rule in writing. Now about car.
Exterior It has balanced fluidic look front, side and rear. Front is same as grand i10 with small changes. Nothing bad. Rear - nothing great. Tail lamps could have been better designed. 
 Side profile is good. Some may not like plastic cladding. Diamond cut alloy wheels are great for looks. I'm Spending approx 30k more for these in SX(O) than SX. ABS comes in SX (O) with alloy wheels 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): This is gadgent heavy which made my decision to go for this over dzire and amaze. Amaze is great on engine, but I couldn't stand (or rather sit) by bland dashboard. Dzire was crunch on back seat space. However, dzire is fun to drive even if Xcent and Dzire is having same size engine and technical specifications. I would say except features/gadgets, Xcent is balanced between Amaze and Dzire. Amaze back seat space is great.
Boot space is leading in all these if that is critical for you. However, I'm not sure how Xcent will respond when loaded with luggage and all 5 passanger.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I drove Xcent multiple times test drive with all 5 passanger loaded. The performance of average. You won't feel great as in Dzire. However, cluch, gears shift is butter smooth. I think, this is good vehicle if you are spending most of the milage in city over highway (which is my case)
Fuel economy, I won't be able to comment much. But, we can bank on grand i10's data being same engine is shared.
Ride Quality & Handling Suspension setup is smooth and can easily consume normal road patterns. Handling wise, steering is bit lifeless. With small turning, you can easliy move vehicle. Good for tricy parking spaces. Rear camera is really helpful in this case. If you leave steering for auto centering after taking turn, it may turn little on other side. Getting good judgement of front reach may take some time as visiblity is not great for front end.
Final Words Go grab this (if you can get in time you can wait). Lowest on price in this compact sedan segement with loaded with features.
Areas of improvement Can I get engine from Dzire to have fun to drive and great features and dashboard, large bootspace from Xcent?

Ride Quality & Handling The ride quality is smooth .Suspension is very good.Handling at corners too is quite comfortable.The seats are comfy, the driving position feels right and the visibility isn't a problem.
Final Words If you want an allrounder, get this car.With all gizoms it VFM. It is indeed a complete family sedan. Enjoyed every aspect of this car. Compared to other cars in this segment, this one surely wins the race.

Exterior
a) Very balanced Look unlike its older competitors from ; Truly it is not Fludidic design of Hyundai but looks very elegant
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
a) Resoanbly spacious; Leg space in back seats are quite good; Boot space is amazing and best in its class
 b) very ergonomically design and features can be accesses very easily
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
a) Fuel Economy ..it is too early. I will pay attention after first servicing on 5th July. But right now for city driving about 14-15km with ac on
 
Ride Quality & Handling
a) Drive is smooth. before buying I had taken ride on i10 Grand and I found it quite satisfactory; Xcent is no different; Since Hyundai cars are inherently designed for city driving, very comfortable to drive around, turning radius is also small
 
Final Words
I feel barring minor drawbacks, what one gets at rs 8L as an overall package is fabulous and I feel I have taken the right decision in going with Xcent  Petrol, top end ver.
Areas of improvement  
a) I had Indica and feel the Width  indside could have been bit more to add some more comfort
b) I drove on highways and clearly above 110-120 km, feels like floating ..however, this is OK and one can not get everything at Rs 8L.
c) single control for both the side mirors - this is surely needs attention. In Indian cities vehcles drive very close to each other due to road width, too many 2 wheelers on the road. So, many a time it is better to keep Non driver side view mirror floded to avoid damage from many senseless drivers. In Xcent, this can not be done. either both open or both remain in folded condition. This should be addressed.

Full Review 
Exterior
 Looks Good. Could have been more fluidic like Amaze/Verna. Inbuilt rear parking sensor helps a lot..
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 S 1.2 is not the top version. Still its jam packed with various features like 2 din Music system, Rear AC Vent (not a fan blower), Steering mount controls, Bluetooth Connectivity. All in all, a very good value for money. Similar features in Amaze/Dzire would require extra investment of   1 lac INR.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Completed 3000 KM today. Engine performace has been quite good till now. Fuel economy somehow has been on better side. I receive 16 KM/L in city and 18.5 KM/L on highways. Perhaps because I drive at constant 40-55 KM/hr in city even if I have to take slighly longer routes and never exceed 90 KM/Hr on highways. Gear Box can be a bit smoother but perhaps slight roughness may go away after first service due this week. 
Acceleration is less than expected. Perhaps it has to do with 3 cylinder engine. It works for me as I am no race freak. Still, 4 cylinder engine would have been better
Ride Quality & Handling
 Excellent handling. Smooth braking.
Final Words
 A real value for money with respect to Dzire and Amaze in similar price range. I should have go for one version higher as for extra investment of 20 K, I could have ABS and Alloy wheels. No regrets

Exterior The front and side looks great but the back side looks a bit compressed. Overall it has more than a decent profile.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) This is where the USP comes in I guess with loads of gizmos, rear ac vents, good legspace and spacious interiors with more than a decent boot space. 10 on 10 here.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is more than decent again but there is a tad bit delay in kicking up a punch in AT version.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is perfect for a city ride but on a highway accelerator needs to be pushed a little bit for a good decent pickup. Handling is smooth and can absorb normal patches on road easily, Ride is a comfort in the city with AT. 
Final Words If you love gizmos and spend most of your time in the city and not a speed freak, then this car is for you :)
Areas of improvement Pickup is a bit slow and need to push on a AT version but once the turbo kicks in its smooth.

Exterior It looks nice.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space is good and that is the only positive thing about the car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is silent but not powerful. You feel it when you switch on the AC. Fuel economy is bad when driving in city with AC on. Gearbox has major problem. Intially it is smoth but after driving few 100 km it starts showing its real face.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is ok when you drive around 80 but once you go beyond 100 km/h speed you does not feel confident. It does not feel stable on high speed.
Final Words I purchased this car on Dec 2014. I was impressed with specifications like rear AC vent, music system, remote dicky open etc. but once i bought the car i felt it was a bad decision. Gearbox has a serious problem. After driving hardly 100 km i started feeling that shifting to first gear is having some problem. I took the vehicle to Dealer and they told that may be you are not pushing the clutch properly and i thought may be they are right but after 15 days it was getting stuck completely. It happened number of times that i was in traffic and then i was unable to push to first gear then i will apply second gear and then car will move. I again took the car to dealer and this time they took test drive and they also agreed for the same. Car was in the garage for 1 week and then they told that problem has been solved but on the same day while driving back to home i felt the same issue. Again i have to go to the dealer this time they kept the car for around 20 days and then they told problem is fixed.
But now after driving few 100 km i noticed that car pickup dies when switching on the AC. I believe this issue was there since starting but i could not notice because of gear problem. Now gear becomes hard sometimes but still it is manageble but power is very less and sometimes vehicles stopes when you are on some overbridge with traffic and you have to stop in between. This is pathatic. I was earlier using Maruti 800 and even if i have to stop on a hill, my car never ever stopped so it is not my driving skill but it is the problem of the Car.
I would suggest go for Maruti Swift or Swift Dezire or any other company but do not go for Hyundai.

Full Review 
Exterior The exterior is good with no complains.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The Xcent petrol is a great car. However a basic feature which is the car AC is crap. Basic problem, the AC cuts off too soon not allowing the car to cool down inside. During summer it will be better to drive with the windows down, rather than trying to cool the car with the AC. Have already repaired for AC 2 times in 4 months. The AC was serviced with gas refilling 1st time, while the second time the AC coil had burned out. Its amazing how the coil of a new car burns out within 4 months of use.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Because the car AC cuts veru quickly, it may seem to give better fuel economy. However if u run the AC on 2 or 3 no. then it hits the fuel economy. So either you get fuel economy or you get cooling inside the car.

Full Review 
Exterior
The style of this compact sedan is exquisite. It looks compact, yet its pretty spacious from the inside. You have already seen its baby version - the Grand i10. This car just has that extra boot space which is pretty big for a car in this segment. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Feature wise no company in India can beat Hyundai in each price segment. This is not perception based but factual. I had considered Swift Dzire & Honda Amaze as well but both lacked interior features. Xcent on the other hand is feature rich. The S version is the mid variant which has an integrated 2Din CD/Aux/USB audio system (1GB internal memory) with steering mounted controls. The system is also equipped with bluetooth for audio & phone calls. Reverse parking sensors & elctronic retractable & adjustable ORVM are very useful & convenient. The blue lit interior lights on the speedometer & audio system looks beautiful and vibrant. Besides, each door has a bottle holder over and above the two bottle holders that are placed near the gear knob. Ample of space for 5 people to sit comfortably, considering they are all lean or at the most moderate in size. The seats are comfortable, especially the rear seats. I personally found the hand room for the driver to be a bit uncomfortable. The buttons for power windows & ORVM on the driver door are awkwardly close to the seat which makes operation uncomfortable. Rear A/C vent, glove box vent & rear charging point are a luxury.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
The engine is pretty smooth and has the power this kind of a car needs. Just the second gear doesn't perform as per my expectations. The car feels a bit sluggish but once you hit the third gear, there's no desire to slow down :). Fuel economy is good. You get a decent 10kmpl with heavy slow moving traffic & about 13kmpl with slight traffic. Yet to take the exhilarting Xcent on the highway to test mileage there. When it comes to gearbox, the Xcent is just as smooth as it's predecessor-Accent. Ultra smooth gear shifting. You just don't feel tired shifting gears even in heavy traffic. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Overall ride quality is very good. The punch you get 3rd gear onwards is thrilling. The car feels pretty light and zippy especially in the city. 
Final Words
Exhilarating Xcent, it truly is. A total value for money family sedan for the Indian buyer. 
Areas of improvement  
Need some more hand room for the driver or probably place the power window controls on the driver side door a few inches towards the dashboard away from the seat. The mechanics of the 2nd gear could be improved to get some more power.

Exterior
 Its exterior is mindblowing. Its shape is quite like Grandi10 but is more specious than Grandi10. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Its features is quite interesting and magnificant at such a low cost. As mentioned above it is quite specious and is even more comfortable than Verna. And more interesting in Xcent Sx and Sx(o) the company has provided the car with start buttom for on/off. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 It is having a engine power of 1198cc with 84bhp power in petrol wich is far more better than Swift dzire(petrol). But one difficulty is there in the car i'e its millage,according to the data of Xcent in the showroom and in the web page,its maillage is 19.2Kmpl but in real in the city, its millage is 12.5Kmpl and 14-15Kmpl in highways without A/C. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Xcent break power is more than Swift dzire even without ABS. I am delightful to drive this car as its handling is quite good. 
Final Words
 Iam delighted to drive this car and hope everyone will like the car. 
Areas of improvement  
 Xcent's Fuel economy should be increased without reducing its engine power by observing the Toyota's Pirus Petrol version.

Exterior is decent , will not call it  a fluidic design as verna.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) is ver good and there is a feel of quite a bit of luxury at this price range specially rear ac vents is fantastic and three persons can sit comfortably on rear seat. The sound system is amazing with 1 GB on internal memory. Not to forget its large boot space.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Have run 800 kms in 1 month but not measured the fuel economy. Some users have told after first servicing, mileage will be around 15-16 km/l with ac  in free city ride.
Ride Quality & Handling Remarkable ride quality . Only problem faced with very sensitive braking as the car was stopped suddenly but got acustomed with in few minutes of ride and now enjoying it. Also, the suspension is a bit stiff as a slight jerk is felt even on smaller road holes.
Final Words Overall the car scores very good in all the features. The gear changing is so smooth and I must say this is the best car available at this price 
Areas of improvement The suspension could be fine-tuned a bit.

Exterior Very good except the back portion which need some change. Better the shape on the back made to that of Accent.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Confortable for 5 persons. Interior very good and pleasing.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I used the car only 100 km and hnece not able to comment on fuel economyt. The engine performance  very good.
Ride Quality & Handling Very smooth to drive  and you really enjoy the driving. Very smooth touch.
Final Words From my drive of 100 km it may not be correct to say a final word. However the 100 km drive gave me a very good experience. I strongly recommend this car to those  who like to migrate from hatch back.
Areas of improvement Back portion need improvment in shape and can be made more cute. Colour options are limited. Some of the colour like blue not very impressive. Even though like  to have a colour car, finally I decided to go for whiote.

Exterior I own the car for past 3 1/2 months. Exteriors are average. I want Hyundai to introduce fluidic version of it.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) It has abundant features. To my liking, it has - Rear defogger, Rear AC vents, Automatic climate control, Handsfree calling.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox City mileage is very less - 13 kmpl. Highway mileage came around 16 kmpl. I have driven all the time with AC on. Gearbox manouvering is real smooth, but slighlty inferior to my Santro ZipPlus that I had owned for 12 yrs.
Ride Quality & Handling Brakes are very bad. It has very sharp brakes. I am worried that some day I might get hit from behind due to abrupt braking. I complained for this to the service center, but they say that it is due to ABS. On the contrary, I just read some other review where the guy said that he is experiencing hard brakes. So, i think that ABS has not been calibrated properly in Xcent resulting in extremes.
Quite a many times, the power steering stops working upon starting. It comes back to normal after some time of driving.
Final Words It's an average car with lots of features.
Areas of improvement Brakes, Power steering, External looks (need to be fluidic like Hyundai's other sedan makes).

I don't have problem with the car however, if anyone would like to go for best and accurate car deal offer you need to visit any other store except the dealer in MITHILA HYUNDAI located in Mira Bhayander.
They would do anything for sales, for the accurate prices also visit any other dealer.
My Bad experience with this dealer was that I had given a booking amount of Rs.5000/- for the Model Xcent and they was never told that this would be refundable which is possible after I confimed with other dealers of Hyundai.After a conversation with other dealers the Booking amount need not be such a small amount of Rs.5000/- as the minimum amount accepted is close to Rs.50,000/-. As I had some medical emergencies at my family so I had to cancel the order for which I visited the store personally and they asked me for a Cancelled cheque and a application in writing stating for refund of the booking amount.
It's been more than 2 months I have been following up and they keep on replying will call you back and once they also said refund not possible.
The sales team there acts really good especially Kaustubh who positively said that he would get back to his manager and help me with the refund in 2 weeks which has not happened till date.
I would like to inform everyone whoever wants to book a HYUNDAI think twice before buying it from MITHILA HYUNDAI for any reason as I have aso heard about its after sales service really not good at all.
It would be great if MITHILA promises to do what it says to it customersRegards,
Karan.

Exterior Best in it's segment, only car which is comparable is Chevorlet's SAIL. However rating the  exterior of a car is very subjective, It is a matter of choice.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Features are most appealing part of this car. Leg space looks a slight issue for driver.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine seems ok specially the noise is very low almost silent, milage is also bearable. Gear  shifting is not that great, but not bad.
Ride Quality & Handling Very good so far.
Final Words Overall a good deal for a small family which do not ride car very heavily.
Areas of improvement Suspension can be improved a lot. In SX version when you want to stop the engine, but to continue the music you will have to press  the stop button and then start the music again. This looks annoying and can be improved. Why one has to enter a minimum of 150 words in this field, This is pathetic.

Exterior
Car has nice looks from the front with fuidic design unlike other competition. Elegant Sedan look from sides with height and length well balanced. On the back, the windshield is nicely merged with the Boot. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
This car has all the features of costly Sedans like Honda City, Vento, Verna etc. except length of 30 cms less. I had test driven, all these cars and finally settled for 'Xcent' which was offering better fetures at much lower cost. Features List is impressive with nicely designed Music system with 4 speakers, USB, Inbuilt memory, Blue tooth, Steering mounted controls, Seat height adjustments, rear vent ac, cabin light at rear, Water bottle holder on all doors, charger point in front and also at back, reversing sensors, Cool glove box etc. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
I have driven this car for last 2 months and clocked 2200 Kms. Engine & Gearbox are nicely matched for City Traffic and Highway and I have managed average milage of 15.7 Kms to a liter of petrol with AC on with mix driving in city+highway. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride quality is excellent. Cabin is silent with outside noise reduced to a large extent. I am thrilled to drive this car. 
Final Words
Best sedan for indian roads. Value for money. Guys go fo this car.
Areas of improvement  
Tyre size can be increased.

Full Review 
Exterior
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 While the overall car is good, a basic feature of the AC is rubbish. I purchased a Xcent Petrol and got the AC of the car repaired 2 times within 4 months of purchase. After that even the AC cooling is very little because the AC cuts off too soon. If you use this car in the summer, you will have the run the car AC on 3, to even feel that the AC is running, while not really cooling the car. The company gives me explanation that technology has changed so it functions differently. They ask me to run the AC on 3, then bring it to 2 and then to 1 to get the car cool. So am expected to do this everytime i start the car on every signal in the city. 
 
Hyundai is fooling its customers as they make the AC cut off sooner than required, automatically increasing the fuel efficiency but leaving the car hot on the inside. I regret my decision of purchasing the car, given Mumbai is hot almost 365 days, but the car is missing a basic feature, cool the inside of the car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Fuel Economy seems good because AC cuts off too soon. However company expects you to run the AC inside the car on a higher blower all the time to get decent cooling, automatically hitting the fuel economy.
Ride Quality & Handling
 
Final Words
 Basic feature of an AC cooling the inside of the car is complete rubbish. You cannot expect even 10% cooling inside when driving during summer.
Areas of improvement  
 Car AC needs a major upgrade

Exterior Is ok.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smooth , Fuel economy is as per the specification  and gearbox is very soft.
Ride Quality & Handling Comfortable for driving.
Final Words It is a complete package having many more latest features at a very affordable price.
Areas of improvement Horn , Automatic door lock anf poor music system quality.
During almost 1500 kms of drive, I realised much more comfort, easy driving. Fuel economy is as per expectation and as claimed by the company. 
I have swift and the major drawback is pickup & power is less. But again swift has some drawback in turn.
There is no second thought about the engine performance. It is too smooth & silent.
In short, the car is launched for a middle class family with full luxury and meeting all the requirements & features same as that available in higher end sedan cars.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Had a major problem with Gear transmission soon after i bought it. While driving the gear would change on its own to lower or upper level. Very erractic behavior. It was in workshop for almost 1.5 months after the purchanse. Persistence efforts and continuous followup - the dealer workshop helped close the matter by replacing the transmission box. Horrible average. Less than 10 in the city.
Ride Quality & Handling There is a persistent noise in the passenger seat. Workshop people agreed there is a strange noise, but could do nothing about it.
Final Words MADE A BIG MISTAKE... NEVER GO FOR IT. Hyundai doesn't care for its customer, once the vehicle is sold. Repeatedly sent many emails, to no avail. Wrote to their big bosses, there was absolutely no satisfactory response. Finally the dealer workshop came to our rescue and helped get the transmission box changed. They themselves followed with Hyundai and got our work done.
Areas of improvement Too many!! Hyundai needs to iprove its customer relationship.

Exterior It exterior look is simple and nice 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) It's interior space & comforts are unparallel in this segment. It has lots of features with advanced technology. It is the first car in the price bracket, which provide the rear AC vent. It's cool glove is fantastic for a long drive in summer. It provides good leg space for back riders and lots of space for luggage.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The inner sealing is very good and makes the noise- free journey. It gives ~ 15km/l in city and 18km/l in the highway. The gear shift is very smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling It provides very comfortable ride and easy handling.
Final Words Those it is my first car which I have purchased in November 2014 and have > 3000km riding/ driving, its give me full satisfaction in all areas. So it is simple a nice family sedan.
Areas of improvement Posterior look and breaking system.

Purchased 2 months back. In parking condition and am sitting inside heard a sound and found back windshield cracked and crumbled without any reason. When taken to Lakshmi Hyundai, Hyderabad..they started forcibly convincing me that something fell on it and this cant happen on its own hence forced me to go for insurance claim for a manufacturing defect. I am shocked and horrified with the safety and security features and the HYUNDAI SERVICE STANDARDS. Would suggest to check all glasses even the joints before finally taking hand over because after that no responsibility will be accepted by the company even within warranty...hence also suggest not to go for extended warranty as these are false promises to increase revenue. Shifted to Hyundai from Maruti and now realising some mistakes: Shifting itself; Paid full amount( finance option) hence cant change immediately; purchasing a new model with no/few feedback in market- this risk can be taken with Honda or Maruti.

Full Review 
Exterior The the  body appears  as if the surface of the tin  sheet is flawed. It does not sport a different look than the I10 Grand.The sheet on the tp is too thin. When it rains the cabin noise is horrible. ( I am from Kerala where the rains are torrential). The windshield is also not very clear especially during rainy night driving and the wipers do not give a clean wipe of the windshield glass.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Feature wise the car has almost  everything except a built in GPS. There is no dead pedal for the automatic version which is a major drawback.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is good, Fuel economy dissappointing.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good but the steering comfort  is not as good as the I10. The worst thing is about the erratic and unpredictable  behaviour of the brakes. They behave in totally different fashions everytime  and I lose my confidence while applying the brakes. 
Final Words The Company has to do some urgent rethinking about the brake system. I have come across others who are having the same problem with the brakes. I have once taken the vehicle to the authorised service centre with the braking problem. Of course, some improvement was there initially but things have again deteriorated.
Areas of improvement Braking system, Front appearance, dead pedal for the auotomatic version.

Exterior Very simple.  styish, dynamic &  looks more complete compare to Dizer & amaze. Diamond cut alloy wheel in SX(O) model gives extra-ordinory looks , Large boot space,
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Simply EXCEPTIONAL is the word i would like to explain interior. Lots of feature at reasonable affordable price. Quality of interior plastic is good too..Cool glove box, Controls on streering wheel, music system, climate control AC, Rear parking camera with sensors, night view mirror, Push button start , smart key , electronically adjustable & retractable OVRM  adds pleasure to driving & gives feeling of luxurios car from inside..not to forget height adjustable driver seat & rear vent AC.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I clocked 1000 km in one month & found pleased with my decison to go for Xcent, i drove almost 800 kms on highways with speed around 80- 100 km/hr & rest of the 200 kms strictly below 30km/hr due to. So average fuel economy came to around 17.5 Km/ L.. which seems to be very satisfactory. Gear box is butter smooth, very easy to change. undoubtly best i saw so far. Great performance above 2000 rpm. Petrol engine is fine tuned & noise inside the cabin is almost zero.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is very comfortable, little bit extra width in rear seat would have been great, seems best Handling car for crowded city area.. Noise insulation is excellent & it's feedback from the people who have driven Desire, amaze, I20 etc.. if you are not adventurous & sporty, you will definetly love this car.
Final Words If you have budget around 7.5 -7.8 lakhs & want to have premium features, shall not have second thought, descision is very simple to make. GO for IT.
Areas of improvement Could have been great car with engine capacity of 1400 CC, gets bit slow while gear shift from 3-4 , 5-4 & 4-5, --- But still acceptable.

Exterior
 Good to look at. Exterior looks pleasing, but very disappointing on the inside
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Very poor in this zone. May be designed to be as most uncomfortable as possible. Seats feel like hard benches. Leads to back pain and severe strain for driver also. Air Conditioning performance is very poor, even though there is supposed to be a vent for the back seats.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Lacks power. If we cross 90, then the vehile wobbles. On the highway, very disappointing. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Not good. Even on National Highway toll roads, it wobbles a lot, not so say anything on bad and not so bad roads. Makes one see a ortho speacialist after every ride. 
Final Words
 It feels like engine mounted on an oil tin. Bad quality seats.Travelled 20400 KMs from July 2014 to Feb 2015. (8 months).Now switched to Hyundai Verna SX(O) CRDI, a time tested car.
Areas of improvement  
 In all areas except outer.

Exterior Xcent indeed looks graceful. Design is curvy and stylish.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) I am astonished to count the number of features offered in SX model including some unique and usable features such as rear AC vent, glove compartment AC. I was sceptical of glove compartment AC. So, I stored half a litre milk at normal temperature in the glove. I set temperature at 24 degree and drove this car for 9 hours. To my astonishment, the milk did curdle and remained cold. Space is adequate for 4, but not for 5 ( 3 in the back) as the passenger in the middle will face rear AC vent quite obstructive.
Night view feature in the mirror is awesome. All you need to do is to press the button at the center to tone down gazes of car lights.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is superb and quieter. I drove on Bangalore H'Way right up to Kolhapur. Fuel economy of 18 KM was achieved. average speed was 70 KM/Hr.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is superb. The only thing, Engine sluggishly responds in lower gears.
Final Words Xcent is surely a better option for peopel tired of using hatchbacks and do not want to spend money to buy full-scale sedans like Vento or Ciaz.

Exterior
The exterior is not the german car or the japanese car types but it is decent as it is a shoot right out of the grand i10, so average looks, but not too bad like the etios or the Amaze.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 The Interiors are really exciting like the Dashboard with Bluetooth technology and steering mounted controls with phone call support as well as the rear AC vents. The bottle holders on the doors hold the normal aquafina or bisleri bottles unlike all other same segment cars.  The Air Conditioning is really very good and at 1 or 2 cools th cabin without the need of the rear ac vents open. the USB doxk and the power inputs are neatly placed and easily accesible as well. ample of space to keep your small titbits. The cool Glove box is also an advantage. The Rear Space is quite good with the armrest and glass holders, but 3 heavy persons will be a bit difficult to accomodate behind. The Drivers Seat height is adjustable ad so is the steering wheel. The Trip meter is super and its controls are on the wheel as well. Only dissapointment is the Horn. It is very stiff and feels plasticky and noisy when in use. But a small issue which can be ignored as every car has its cons.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 The Engine is Wow...I didnt think i would get such a good mileage on the car as i just travelled to pune and back and the car gave me an average of 20 kmpl, which is amazing for a petrol car,
Yes the engine is a bit slower on the highways but there is a technique to handle it, like whenever i needed some power for overtaking or something simila I always used to upShift first see how the gear is coping and then down shift for max torque and when the momentum is back I upshift again. this way I have got good results. But in the City traffic it is the best car which even beats the Dzire, it is too good for crowded areas and you can easily manouvre it smoothly.
Ride Quality & Handling
 The Handling of the Car is very practical and very smooth just like the Polo. It gives the feel of safety and comfort together and in sticky areas it is very good. I only sat once in the rear seat as i am the only driver in my family but when i was seated it felt like you are in a sedan and the bumps were very little to feel, beautiful Suspension.
Final Words
 Well I would recommend this car to them whose budget is just under 7 and are probably looking for a small car. This car is a dark knight amongst all other cars in its segment. The service is excellent. I had researched so many cars before this decision of mine . like the dzire the amaze even the polo but feature wise and price wise this car was the best along with the zest but the zest being a tata product and because of its bad service history I rejected it. The only car which was competition was the Dzire but it offered only half of the features which the xcent offered. Therefore We chose the Xcent and are very happy for our decision. Kudos Hyundai
Areas of improvement  
 Only area for improvement I guess is the Horn and the Braking which you have to get used to after some time, Rest all is all shiny for the Xcent.

 Less power and milage is less ~9 Kmpl for the first month what I got
Ride Quality & Handling Great vehical,handling
 Qaulity of ride is good, light steering and easy to control
Final Words
I bought Hyundai Xcent SX(O) Petrol like a month back, and till now I am satisfied with the vehical,
Car is good,awesome features ,looks and handling.
Found the Milage was around 8~10 Kmpl for the first month with AC on, 
Space in th back seat is enough for 2 people to sit comfortably.
With AC on you need to dig your leg into accelarator for pickup.
AC is good with the SX(O) option Petrol, what I have it offers Automatic climate control feature to adjust the temperature.
Rear camera is cool feature and helpful as well.
ABS works well although wont be much evident when driving in city.
Boot space is awesome, Biggest in the segment. 
My suggestion would be that if you want to buy this car its a good overall package but if you can increase your budget a bit go for a actual sedan like verna or city rather than compact sedan.
Areas of improvement  
less Milage, less space,Less power, also if a hand rest is provided for the driver that would be great

Very good from the front and side profile. Ugly at the rear.
 
 Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)                                                                                                     

Rear comfort is good being a compact sedan for the reclined seat back, but thigh support in both front & rear seats is not as good as my i20. Space in the rear is just good for three average people. Rear leg room is good, much better than dezire. front space is also good. Best features includes rear A/C, driver seat height adjustment, electric folding ORVMs, electric adjustable ORVMs, rear parking sensor, rear view camera, bluetooth connectivity, steering mounted audio and phone controls, 1gb internal memory for songs and phonebook contacts,407 ltrs boot and lots and lots more. Dzire and Amaze lag far behind in this aspect.
 
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox

Nice silent kappa2 engine. In the city very good to drive in the traffic. Good pick updue to decent low end torque means less gear shifting. But  on the highways it has a soft, gradual pick up. In my earlier  i 20 diesel, it was like a jet.
Mileage:   I Checked nearly 10 times: 12-13kmpl in city with 100% A.C  , 16-17kmpl on highway with 100% A.C  and 20.5kmpl with no A.C on highway.   Gear lever is placed up near the front console but its shifting quality is just average.
 
Ride Quality & Handling   
 
Ride quality is decent and the car grips well on highway at speed. Body roll is very less while steering in the curves. My i 20 was very bad in this regard . The car is very stable and suspension is better than hyundai's reputation. Steering is smooth and better than earlier hyundai cars but amaze is far more ahead in this regard. Steering in amaze is amazing. Braking is very instant and sharp and it takes a few days for the driver to adjust.

Final Words     
 
A very good car at this price point. Good engine, good fuel ecinomy, space and features with hyundai's good after sales service its really tempting if you can bear with that ugly rear.

Exterior Exterior is good, missing fluid concept at back side. Alloy wheels really matches with the design.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very well managed space, comfirt. Features are good. Music system is good. Dashboard is managed well. Rear AC vents are good. Bootspace is good and vell managed. ACC is good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine offers more economy than company suggests. 1.2 petrol engine giving a very strong response wherever required. Gearbox is very easy and operates very smoothly.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride qualiry is we managed and handling wiht ABS is very + point(It survived me twice :P). Drive the cars with the speed of almost 120/130 and stable on the road, no scary feeling.
Final Words Value for money really and Hyundai managed it very well. 4 mtr sadan is really a good option for the people who is looking for budgetr sadan. 5 average adults can easilly adjust.
Areas of improvement Add fludic design to exterior, basically at the back side. Only aera they can improve.

Compact compare to other in same segment, however gives sporty look. Non fluidic design but gives enough space for a small family. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Features like keyless entry and start/stop is unique. Gear Shift display helps in saving fuel, Cooling Glove box is an excellent add on.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Excellent, as just driven 100 odd kilometeres so can't comment on economy factor. Gear Shift is smooth and quick. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Smooth........, Handling. Good Torque and remarkable accelration.
Final Words
 Overall an excellent deal and value for money. Other manufacturers are providing less features and charges more. The Korea tech has been well tested and has produced veh as per Indian road condition. Less versions makes purchaser to choose easily without confusiing him/her.
Areas of improvement  
 Company fitted 2 Din should have be given as optional accessory. Seat fitted head-rest doesn't make any sense. It should have an option of GPS and other latest technology in it.

Horrible braking....I brought this car before 1 month..now 1500 Km is over..But i am not satisfied about braking system of my Xcent..its very horrible and uncomfort for passengers..when I  touch the break pedal the car was stopped suddenly.This braking system is not good for city driving. I went to the dealer but they are telling this is the new system of hyundai xcent and grand I10....I hope hyundai will resolve this isuue..
2. A/C gas leaked after 1300 km. Ac gas leaked from my car after done my 1st service.
3. Spare shotage. after found Ac gas leak.. The mechanic telling spare parts is not available..it will take 3 or for days to repair my car. mudflap,& body cover are necessery  need full things for new cars.but this items also not available.

Exterior Desine is best (try to put a chrome grill in front,it enhances the look of the car and looks like a costly car.Rest all is good.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) is very very much comfortable and the reare ac vent cools the back cabin very faster.Back leg room space is very spacious but the space decreases upto 2 inch afer you put a costly seat cover of 16k.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox all are very good in the segment, my xcent shows 18.5 in highway and 15.5 in city drive with fully continious ac.
 
Ride Quality & Handling is also very good.
 
Final Words if you are planning to buy a sedane car in 7.4 lakhs then go for it,its the best.
 
I think the car is fully perfect and did not need any type of improvements
 
I also have a i10 sportz car 1.2 kappa2 and it is also very comfertable,i go to my office in my car and long drive,parties in my xcent.

 Quality of dealership, as my experience at Himgiri Gurgaon was so bad that i will think next time to buy a Hyundai Car as they failed to keep their word and give Foot mat  etc of I10 without even telling us and term of insurance is different from what i asked for and forced to buy insurance from them. Unable to deliver car on time, i had not received my accessory bill so far. So Hyundai to ensure that buyer get good experience at their dealer and have control over them

Exterior Much better looking than others in this segment and has a really solid built quality.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The best looking interiors in the segment without a shadow of doubt. Slightly less spacious than the Zest though. Zest is indeed a bit wider but still 3 people can comfortably sit on the back seat in Xcent.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Driven for 2000 kms, average 12-15kmpl in city with ac on, the engine is powerful enough for this segment, has a very smooth gear box.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent ride quality and handling in the city. The overall better built quality of this car gives it much more stability on city roads as compared to others in the segment.
Final Word The most complete package in this segment. Good performance, well built, stylish looks, best in class interiors, loaded with features and a good fuel economy. I got a pretty good deal as well from the dealer (Hans Hyundai Moti Nagar) at the time of purchase. Got the first service done and was totally satisfied. If you are in the market for a new car and have budget of 7-8 lacs, I would surely recommend you the Xcent SX (O) 1.2. Simply because it is the best value for money in this segment and does not really have a weak area.

Exterior: -Exteriors are excellent. It is having the highest ground clerane among all the cars in this segment. Metallic colour finish is very attractive. Perfect balance looks which resembles the design of high end sedan car.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): - Features are really attractive. Car Boot space is ample and rididng is very comfortable. Rear AC vents and steering mounted control are the added advantage in Xcent which no car in this segment is having at such a low price. Sound system is excellent.  Driver seat height adjustment is the additonal advantage.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: - Engine performance is very good. You will not hear a sound when engine is ON. fuel economy is perfect. Giving almost the average of 19 with AC on Highway and 17 in city limits.
 
Ride Quality & Handling : - Ride quality is excellent and handling is very smooth. 
 
Final Words: - REAL VALUE FOR MONEY CARE. And additionally the support given at showroom is very good. They have expained all the features of cars at the time of delievery and most important that  they kept their commitment and delievered the vehicle on time.
 
Areas of improvement : - I feel horn should be little more powerful specially it has been felt in the traffic of city limits.

Exterior Looks like curze and sure we can it is  a mini-Curze. good in edges and curves. Head lamp and tail lamp feels different compared to other sedans. Cervrolet badge looks stunning feel like luxury car. Sure people go for second look on load.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) It really good for spac and comfort, I had test drive Zest, swift, amaze but its not good in space comfort on rear seat and very hard for long drive but in sail has more space on boot and good for long drive too. New sail looks more luxury when compared to old sail. It gives additional elegant look.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Really I dont about emgine performance but till now i did not face any problem on engine and no sounds from engine. Fuel economy around 17 per lit. with AC.
Ride Quality & Handling While coming to ride, smooth to drive feels like driving a luxury car. Handling also good no more disadvantage on it.
Final Words I suggest Sail is good to among Zest, dizre,amaze and xcent. You will be look different when you are with sail on road because few sail only occurs on roads. sure your car will be watchable from people on road side. Instead of buying compact sedan with less space and comfort please go for sail. Its a family car with royal look.

xcent -not find anything
Final Words
I had driven few Km of My NEW CHEVY SAIL till now i did not face any problem.
Now my friends and relative felt for missed to buy sail because without knowing about sail they bought other cars.
Sail will be best in space, safety and look compared to other compact sedan.

Hi,
I am a PhD student and during the final phase of my thesis (Oct-Dec,2014) was looking to buy my first car.
Did an Extensive Research on various cars and their models. Gone through reviews of various cars at mouthshut.com, team-bhp etc. Was going to book Amaze but suddenly this car caught my attention.
Got a very well-behaved Sales representative and till now I liked the behaviour of Chevy representatives at multiple showrooms that i have visited randomly  in the Hyderabad City.
As my budget was 6.5 lacs and would driving occasionally, I was bent on a petrol version. As i already own a Hyundai Santro at Home; At here( Hyderabad) was looking for a Sedan ( since compact sedans like Dzire., Xcent and Amaze are ruling the market :D) 
Did a sufficient amount of research on sail sedan and talked with the customers at service centres of different car models like Xcent, Amaze including premium Hatchbacks like Grand i10  and Brio ( these two was also somehow in my Consideration set).
Finally, got the delivery of my car on 31st Dec, 2014 in the evening.
Started Sailing from 1st Jan, 2015. I am very satisfied with my research on various models as it indeed helped me to best utilize my investment instead of falling in the category of Common Crowd and going for Dzire, Xcent or Amaze.
I am not criticizing other brands or their models; but at the same time i really dnt find any solid reason why this car has been under-rated.
I am getting fuel efficiency of around 15.8 Kmpl ( even before first service). Whats more I need from a Mid-size Sedan even before first service. Chevy should really promote this car (I guess that is what was missing really as  i too, like many. were not much informed of this car).
Engine: I really find the SMARTECH engine butter smooth without any vibration (till now). Next the throttle is linear and Clutch and Accerlation is very smooth in their delivery.
Hence, I seriously appraise Maruti, Hyundai and Honda for their beauties : Dzire, Xcent and AMaze; but at the same time I have fallen for this wonderful Chevy SAil!!!
Exterior Excellent car, not falls in the Compact Sedan Class, I would rather say an under-rated car......not much sales figure like Dzire, Amze and Xcent. and hence not so much seen on Indian Roads.I feel Chevy shoudl promote properly. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Supspension is one the best in its class and much better than Dzire, Xcent and Amaze.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Butter Smooth Engine; (I have test driven Amaze; xcent and Dzire and seriously I dnt find hardly any difference in engine smoothness compared to the most popular Kappa 2 VTVT Engine of marutis and Hyundai; and also with I-vtec of Honda.).They are definitely smooth; but SMARTECH is not less at the least  in terms of response, drivalibility, throttle, engine sound and vibration. Its equally capable thats all I can say (at the least) if not better.
Ride Quality & Handling Chevy cars ( including Sail Sedan) are best known for fine-tuned suspension. Its really one of the best and well-balanced suspensions among its class of cars.
Final Words I have fallen in love with this brand ( which was least aware of
Areas of improvement The only areas of improvement that I strongly feel Chevy should look into (for all its cars): interior plastic quality and fit and finish!

Full Review 
Exterior is the best as compared to other sedan rivals. It is much better in looks compared with desire, amez etc.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) When I compared with other I feel most comfortable car for driving, best for space, in case of features it has all require features.... if they add stearing control then it will better than best. but the other side of coin is cause of absence of stearing control driver will concentrate on driving only  this is my thought process.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is more than avrage, very smooth engine, better fuel economy, best sedan car for city traffic also, during take over require to shift to the lower gear when in slop...but oiverall the more than avarage engine perfomance.
Ride Quality & Handling Very comfortable ride quality. I drive continously 300KM no any issue or backpain etc . As ABS is very effective it also helps in controling the car when it above 100 km/hour.
Final Words When I decided  to purchase the Chevy SAIL SEDAN. Every one surprized. About my choice. They suggest Desize or Amez. but now everyone again surprized that how this exellant car ignore by indians. Because we people blindly follow the things without any study. I personally found SAIL-SEDAN is much much better than DESIRE, AMEZ, i-20. It is a proper sedan car. which improve your status. It will definately noticed in crowd.
Areas of improvement Should add Stearing controll, the power window control gave at infront of gear knob so it should improve.

Full Review 
Exterior Excellent style for sedan at this price range, No competion at all. It will definitely attract eyes of many when you are riding through the city. Look like a premium sedan from outside.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Eventhough there is enough space and pockets for holding necessary things, Interior plastic quality should have been better. Not meeting the expectation of a GM customer. Must plan for some upgradation in interior.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Very smooth engine. A nice one to drive you are not expecting a very aggressive drive. Torque and power generation is very linear so that it will not make you any discomfort while riding through a busy city traffic.  Fuel economy is average. You may expect much more higher mileage if most of your rides are through city. Mileage is coming down sharply when you are in heavy traffic. Gear box lacks power at fourth and fifth gears. A gear shift is necessary to overtake a truck.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent ride and handling. Suspension is superbly tuned for indian roads.
Final Words A good choice if you are not worried about Interiors and Power.
Areas of improvement Definitely plastic quality. Audio Controls on steering. Aesthitically Better steering wheel. If possible a much more powerfull engine.

Exterior AWESOME LOOKING CAR FOR BUDGET BUYER WITH A TASTE
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)SPACIOUS, REAL SPACIOUS, WITH A LOTS OF STORAGE SPACE. FEATURES AS ONE SHOULD KNOW COME WITH A PRICE SO THE MORE YOU ARE WIILING TO SPEND THE MORE FEATURES YOU'LL GET. SIMPLES. COMFORTABLE IT IS. ESPECIALLY THE WINDOW BUTTONS ON THE CENTRE PEDESTAL NEAR THE GEAR KNOB. GIVES THE RIGHT HANDED AN ADVANTAGE OF MANEUVERING WHILE LEFT HAND CONTROLS THE WINDOW GLASSES. NOISE SETTING IN AT TIMES FROM THE FRONT LEFT DASH IS ANNOYING THOUGH GOTTA REPORT THIS BACK TO THE SERVICE CENTRE FOR RECTIFICATION.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox GOOD ENOUGH. ECON. +18 HIGHWAY, GEARBOX IS TRICKY BUT I GUESS YOU GET USED TO IT. ALSO THE CLUTCH AND GEAR CHANGE IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE BUT I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS ADJUSTING, AND SO AM NOT EXACTLY COMPLAINING.
 
Ride Quality & Handling RIDE QUALITY VERY GOOD. I LOVE THE FEATHER LIGHT STEERING. MAKES FOR QUICK MANEUVRING AND ESPECIALLY ALOT LESS TIRING THAN MANY OTHERS. THOUGH THE CABIN IS QUITE BUT THE PECULIAR PROBLEM WITH THE FRONT DASH(PLASTIC) I GUESS CAN MAKE ANNOYING CHOON CHOON NOICE LOL. SOMEWHAT LIKE AN OLD KHATIYA. LIKE I SAID GONNA TALK TO THE SERVICE CENTRE SOON ABOUT THIS.
 
Final Words GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY BUY FOR AN ENTRY LEVEL SEDAN(AND NOT A SUB THIS -SUB THAT SUBWAY "4" INCHES SANDWICH WITH NO IDEA ON WHO NIBBLED ON THE "2" MORE YOU SHOULD BE GETTING FOR THE PRICE YOU PAID)

Full Review 
I purchased base model of Chevy sail Sedan (Petrol) car in Ajmer (Rajasthan) one and half year ago. There is no antenna for FM radio. The company told me that FM will run with in-built antenna. But that is not working. So cant play FM radio. The mileage is just 10-11 KMPL in city and only 12-12.5 KMPL on highways. I'm not from  Tata /Birla family that can afford such car. Shown to company engineers and also executives from HQ (Gurgaon) many a times. But no improvement. Thinking to move to court of law i.e. consumer forum for having cheated on me. I would advise people not to buy this model of car. Because after sale services are very poor from the company. I'm satisfied with the exterior looks of the car but the performance is hopeless.
The company should look into these shortcomings in the car. And try to launch the product after full checking about the performance of the product.

Exterior Absolutely it has eye catching Exterior with value of money the car. You cant expect Honda Accord Exterior.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) No any comparison of the space and comfort...its awesome. I may sound bit weird but I have found amaze more spacious than CITY by simple observarion " in city, when u sit back driver seems too close to you where as when u sit in amaze driver is too far from you " (with same seat positionting of driver)The model I booked SMT Petrol has all features which I was looking for. Any modification like fog light, double horn may cost u a lot. Because such modification will violate warranty rules.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Not aware as of now. I am first time buyer of the car. What I trusted is the HONDA name and various positive reviews on internet about AMAZE. Hope I wont regret!!
Ride Quality & Handling Looks good. I watched others while taking test drive.
Final Words Go for it. I did not find any major reason to reject or object this car.. Everything looks okay and has better quality than other cars in the market of similar range. Most importantly the service of Honda is much reliable than Maruti. Its bit expensive but reliable. If you have accessible service centers then should not worry about service. I met many HONDA car owners  who came to book their second car from HONDA. So the interaction with them helped to make my decision for going for my first ever car i.e. amaze petrol car.

Cheap quality interiors, sluggish acceleration on highway so be careful while overtaking


Full Review 
Exterior Very good looking car as compared to Maruti Swift Dzire, very stylish small sedan for first time sedan buyers like me.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Loads of space for rear passengers especially older people who can easily get in & out of the car, very comfortable seats. No automatic badging on the rear so people wont know that this is manual or auto transmission, large boot space.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smooth automatic gearbox, ok mileage (am getting 13 kpl now after 12000 kms within city limits i.e. when the car is driven with ECO light on i.e. no hard pressing the accelerator pedal).
Biggest drawback is sluggish acceleration between 60-80kmph i.e. I need to really plan when to overtake other vehicles on the highway, once the car upshifts to the highest gear, then no problem.
Ride Quality & Handling So far very good but on turns & corners, there is some amount of body roll which is not very pleasant.
Final Words I am a very lazy person who gets bored changing gears so went for this car which is the most VFM car at this price range. So far I am very satisfied with the performance of the car as well as the Hallmark Honda showroom staff for their after sales service which is much better than the Hyundai team.
Areas of improvement Better interior plastic fittings, maybe bluetooth connectivity with auto climate control, cruise control on automatic version.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Comfort to sit on back, OK with front (means owners car, not for drivers). Great cabin space under 4m Sedan, Well enough boot space. Without trouble 6ft can sit in front or back row. More than its competitor giving. Low cost interiors, Low cost ICE, No power socket.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox No need to tell about engine. Its Honda IVTEC, already proven. Smooth gearshift. In city 13-15. Highways 16-17
Ride Quality & Handling Very much comfartable to ride in city as well as highways. Nice to drive in low as well as high speeds (not crossed 100. But till 100 it was comfort)
Final Words Amazing car. But Honda missed something due to urgency or cost cutting. Overall its better than its competitor.

Full Review 
Its my first car and someone else drove it to my house for delivery so now you know how much I know about driving .. Having said that, i researched for almost 2 years and seen plenty reviews on Youtube. I was utterly confused what to buy for my first car. Well if you know how to drive then probably you can make some choice by driving the test vehicles, however all the test drive pieces are tuned up so you won’t get what you have tested. So it’s not always about how the vehicle drives in your test drive. And for this particular vehicle, even reviews were not available from any of the reliable sources. In utter dilemma I just decided to look for three things:
Company Reputation, Specs on Paper, My own Instinct and you know what, it did paid me to own one!
I am a former employee of a Japanese Company and for sure i know that they do what they say. And they do it for the name they carry rather than money they charge.
So all in all, it was a calculated risk at the time of purchase.
Read on for a detailed review.
Exterior Its not a merc but how dare you even dream to own a merc in 5.85L. What you get is "the best character lines, from chrome grill and a well-integrated boot". Its way better than bestselling swift desire (snapped on boot over a reluctant swift) or Hyundai Xcent (Its even crampier than a hatchback) or Tata Zest (hey ! its Tata man, how dare you expect anything sportier than a 407 truck).
And you know what, even in the lowest model EMT, they won’t give a ugly cutout for fog lamps. The front bumper is purely pristine, without any cheap cuts/grooves. 
So, it is the best looking car in sub 4 meter sedan category. mark my words, Honda did a great job in styling the car and they nailed it in a big way.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) You sit inside and first thing you notice is the space. The cabin is sound proof and very comfortable. Seats are with good back & thigh support. Two tone beige interiors , all 4 power window, power steering, central lock, leather seat covers is standard even for the lowest version. 
The instrument panel is the simplest one and literally they give nothing in EiMT. Which I purchased. Well its a blessing in disguise as I spent some 18k for AVN, 1k for Reverse cam,900 Rs for wheel cap, 3k for 3d Mats & 1K for Remote keyless entry and vola! Its even sportier than a fully loaded Zest for fraction of pricing. If you sit inside my Amaze E MT, i bet you will ask from where i purchased the stuff. Well just a hint though. God made human and rest is all made in china.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I dont know much about engines but having said that, it picks the whole vehicle nicely, never runs out of power even on 2nd gear and AC on. The gear stick never vibrates, so it has a very refined petrol engine and a very silent cabin. I am drawing 14.5 to 15.5 Kmpl in city  driving. I know you would throw this in disbelief but tell you what, just try to drive the car so that the ECO light is always on and you would see it will give even higher mileage. Its not a nano so dont expect 25 kmpl.
Ride Quality & Handling It is indeed a pleasure to drive this peppy vehicle. I learnt how to drive a car in this very vehicle. The steering wheel gives you confidence while on road. The handling is perfect. Recently I have driven a Hyundai grand i10 and felt like tumbling at the sharp turn. Desire gives you a feel like you are towing a mini truck. 
The longest trip i did was of 200 Kms and i know its nothing. But what I learnt is, it creates a sense of confidence on road and want you to love driving. You won’t get tired by driving it and that’s what matters to me.
Final Words Its a very nice car with very balanced profile, It has a nice & peppy engine, lighter curb and spacious cabin. Engine immobilizer, power windows, power steering, dual tone interiors, a very powerful AC and the name Honda. I just admire it whenever I drive it.
So for the non-so-known, non geeky, regular office going, low on budget fellows, I say just go for it. Forget about regrets, you will love it to drive and people envy you for owning a Honda in less than 6 Lakhs.
Areas of improvement I wish Honda could give more accessories for the Car. I would have fitted a power assisted side mirrors. :)

Final Words I bought a newly launched Honda Amaze (Petrol) on 18.05.2013. It has clocked only 4000 KMs. After 1st service i noticed a little sound (kir-kir) from the engine, while I release or press the clutch plate. I immediately informed this sound to the Honda dealer ( Ring Road-Honda) from where i purchased my car. they said no such type of sound is coming. Again at the time of second service, I informed this sound to the dealer and asked him to rectify the problem. they inspected the car and said no such type of sound is coming. but i used to notice this sound on regular basis.
Today, at around 5:00 PM, my car started shaking while I was driving my car, A malfunctioning light also started blinking. I immediately stopped the car, waited for a while and drove it back to my house, which was just half a kilometer away from the spot.
I got very disappointed today. I never thought of happening this type of problem from such a reputed Car maker.

Ride Quality & Handling I prefer to ride around city with no issues of sneaking in traffic and easy U-turn, Amaze is good at this.
Final Words Although cost is not a factor for me to buy big sedan, I wanted to drive atleast 30 kms daily to work and in the traffic. I like to drive and get ahead of other vehicles in the traffic, so I wanted medium/small size sedan, also I have past experience driving Toyota and Honda cars in US, I like Honda cars for good pickup and suspension. I have been driving Amaze for 7 days now, except fews cosmetic issues (Horn, attached head rests), I like Amaze for compact and engine power along with Honda brand.
I'm disappointed that for the money paid for S variant, airbags should have been included.
Areas of improvement Horn, Detach the head rest from seats, Storage space, Include airbags as standard.

Final Words : I don't understand that why HONDA is recommending the servicing after every 6 Months or every 10,000 Kms,whichever is earlier.My car has clocked only 10,000 Kms in one year but it has gone for servicing FOUR Times so far.After Every six months they are changing the Engine oil / Air Filter etc.I feel that this is not fair and purely a case of cheating so that they can extract the money from the customer.While we asked the service centre about the fuel economy then I got the reply that car should run without A.C. and at a speed of 70 Km/Hr on the highways then you will get the mileage of 18 Km/Hr,which looks very funny.
 
Areas of improvement : Servicing time needs to be increased and Fuel economy to be Improved.

Exterior Excellent one, Amaze is releally supperior in this area, only door latch seems to be weak.Ground clearance is a big concern.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Front seat is of cheap quality.Rest of things are superb
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Both are at par but desire(P) is havinng better fuel efficiency.The power for both the car is at par.
Ride Quality & Handling Both are at par.
Final Words Cost of Amaze(P) is slightly higher, while desire is offering more featuers in lower cost. It seems that Honda has concentered on diesel version only.
Areas of improvement The sell of AMAZE can be doubled if HONDA improve on ground clearance, front seat and small things like door latch and remote door open in top model.
SMT(P) should atleat keep at par with diesel version feather. It must have ABS & fog lamp. There is lot of gap between VX and s MODEL CARS. lIKE.
Even the base model of disel car is having ABS while in petrol only top model is having this feature. Honda should at least generalise this for all the variants, if rellet wants to defeat DESIRE for both diesel and petrol variants.

Full Review 
Exterior: I own an i20 so compared to that style quotient needs a big time improvement. Rear of the car is better designed than the front,especially the tail lamp cluster is cool at night. Low power bulbs and a horn that rivals and I fact fails against a scooty! Honda shouldn't have compromised on the sheet metal thickness. The usual "thud" sound while closing the door in German vehicles or even an i20 is missing. Which takes away the confidence on the safety aspect.
Interiors: Plain simple and uninteresting. What hits u when u is the poor quality of plastics that have been used. Glove box is essentialy jus a hole in the dashboard in the name of making more leg room Honda has messed it up by scooping out portions of the box. No dead pedal in the foot well,with ur left foot having to do nothing in the auto version. It is quite awkward. I especially have a problem with the differential height levels between accelerator pedal and the break pedal, with the former being at a lower level than the latter.this makes it difficult each time u have to lift ur leg fully up to engage the break pedal. Very poor thigh support aggravates the problem. Finding the right seating position is difficult due to the above reason. Good space and Decent rear seats with centre arm rest is a good upmarket style. Steering wheel is comfortable to hold with good contour. No CD player natural as we now hardly use it when USB and aux slots are provisioned Along with integrated 2din audio system. mobile phones and coins can be parked in the holes in Dash and near gear knob. Big water bottle can be stored in the rear seat doors while small ones in the front door socket.
Engine: Frugal 1.2 litre engine has enough grunt to make it thru daily office commute. I would be confident of taking it over difficult urban obstacles! it returns a decent 9 to 10kM per litre considering this being an auto. Manual am said gives 12 to 13 In city. Eco mode is very helpful especially if u r a first time automatic user. It is peppy when u down the gas pedal but I wou recommend it if u r a person who's concerned about mileage. Well refined engine that gives a lot of pleasu to drive. The usual  Honda symbol. Overall a good car if u r looking for a small sedan with a good brand name and value for money.

Amaze has got the best looks in the compact sedan segment. They have built the car on the same platform as that of Brio but the overall design has come out really well. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 If you are looking for a car with a good leg space this car is for you. They have amazingly managed the space and that makes it a very comfortable car. The boot space is equally large. THe interiors look a bit simple and that is an area of improvement for the car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Petrol engine is absolutely fine. I haven't driven the diesel so can't really comment on it. Fuel economy is the best in the segment.
Ride Quality & Handling
The car has got good power inspite of a good mileage. The ride quality is also decent.
Final Words
 If you are looking for a nice compact sedan car in petrol you can certainly go for this car over dzire.
Areas of improvement  
 Head rest for seats and a better looking dashboard.

Exterior Yes, it is amazingly stylish, good curves, stylish side lines similar to verna with stylish tail light similar to city, but not aggressive from the front at the same time.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Looks same as of brio, dint attract much, dash board too is not appealing also metering light is not good.  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine looks refines wityh very low noise and vibration at idling, but sonds higher as soon as you give acceleration specially on higher RPM's the engine becomes noisier.
Acceleration is not as good as looks on paper, torque is lower than the swift Dzire. Gear shifting should have been a bit smoother. Economy hav't judged yet, as i had driven a only few kilometers. 
Ride Quality & Handling The riding is smooth with good grip on road and easy handling with pleasing steering control. It is very much appreciable that Honda has given four Power windows, Power steering ABS & EBD with AC & heater even to its basic variant.
Final Words Yes it is a attractive package offered by Honda and will defineitely give the Dzire a tough cutthroat fight. BUT ITS BASIC VARIANT WILL PROVE TO BE AN ACE OVER THE DZIRE AND WILL DEFINITELY GET BETTER SALES FIGURES AS COMPARED TO ITS OTHER VARIANTS.
Areas of improvement Change in head lights, Dashboard, Metering light is definitely required alongwith improvement in ground clearnce and width.

Exterior As compared to other comparative sedans, it has awesome exteriors. A new generation car, ample of boot space and the fascinating Majestic Blue colour I purchased. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Enough of leg space, it surely adds to comfort of all. Five adults can very easily occupy the rear seat. Cup holders add on to luxury of this car. Interiors though don't seem to be expensive kind, but as far as other features are good, certainly quality of interiors don't pinch hard.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Smooth gearbox, I was not accustomed to any geared vehicle and was bit scared to handle one with Amaze. But changing the gear with this car is quite easy, quite smooth slide.
Ride Quality & Handling Driving Amaze is my new PASSION.
Final Words On Indian roads, Honda, Hyundai & Maruti ar ethe only three brand names I can rely upon. It was basically the exteriors and Honda brand name that I cancelled booking of Dzire n went for Amaze even without giving a second thought to it.
Areas of improvement NA.

Full Review 
Exterior Awesome Exteriors. My family fall in love we first saw it on 26th March,2013.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Comfortable seats, Space is seen everywhere, Lots of Bottole Hoders, Hight of Seat is Adjustable, No adjustable Head rests but I never needed those when on a Drive for about 1 hour.
Dash board is basic. Doesn't looks ugly but if it could have been sloped toward the Front Windsheild it would have been more useful as you tend to place objects in your hand at the Dashboard. I placed the Gift back given by the Showroom there but it was constantly sliding down. Fronts seats have lots of leg room, even if the seats are moved forward. Rear seats too very spacious and comfortable. Boot space is more then needed for an average family of 4-5 members.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Very smooth, At Ideal condition I sometime miss jugded that Its off. Its silent. Steering is also Light and smooth, for the first time car owner I was very easily making the hard turns.
Gears are not super smooth but Smooth and I don't feel that this matters much.
Fuel Economy: 
Plains:  Distance: 156Km including city driving and 10 km Hill driving. --- 18.2 Km/lt.
Hills: Distance 186km:---- 16.3 km/lt.
 
Ride Quality & Handling I will rate it 5 stars.
Final Words Guys go for it if you need more space inside and boot, Modern looks outside. Otherwise a cheaper option is Dzire VX model in compared to Amaze SMT-iVTEC (in Uttarakhand). As I am surpriced that the ex showroom price difference is about 15k more where else it only 2.5k in Brio model.
Areas of improvement Dash board. SMT-ivtech should be more cheaper. ABS should be offered in this S-MT petrol also for the price difference it has to the top model.

Exterior Good design. much better than Competition.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Ample Space. Very Bad front seat.worse than an auto. Basic features availble. All road noise creeps in so on long trips u will get irritated. Even in city One wil get iritated as there is no insulation for engine noise or for noise on road.Wonder how Honda allowed such low quality car to be launched in its brand name.
Ride Quality & Handling Very very poor. Decided not to use his car for trips outside city limits. suspention is very bad. There is almost no noise insulation. Amazed to see all the engine noise audible inside the car!!when it rain it seems as if u are sitting below a tin roof.
Final Words Not at all Amazed. Feel cheated. Very pathetic dealer service further aggrevates the problem.
Areas of improvement Except the ample space inside there are lot of problems wih this car specially suspention, noise insulation, front seat wih no upper back support, music system is also pathetic.

PROS: has USB where external drive can be connected.
Very spacious, with ample leg space and thigh support. Driver seat height adjustment very useful during long distance drives.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good.While driving its driving smooth with good pick up and no sound in petrol version. Its gear sometimes get stuck whileputting second gear especially. The gear is easy to use. Rear defogger is a welcome feature. The AC is ultra-powerful, I never go above level 1. If you have occupants at back seats, you may increase AC level.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good but for the vibration felt by the driver when rpm is more. Very stable at high speeds and handles corners very easily even at high speeds. Very stiff suspension and hence handles small bumps with a thud if not taken slowly.
Final Words Good Value for money.
Areas of improvement Need improvement on features especially on high end.

 Looks Good and is impressive, sleek
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Fittings not up to the mark but space is good. Seats could have been better.
Some things like mats should have been included.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine is silent. Not fuel economical
Ride Quality & Handling
 Smooth ride and good on highway. though while overtaking, one can feel the lack of engine power
Final Words
we expect much when we buy from Honda. This offering has room for improvement and is much compromised just to bring down cost and cater to a new middle segment between Brio and City.
Areas of improvement  
 Fuel efficiency: must give 14 in city run as claimed and 20 on highway
Fittings like side mirrors should be better; with notches so that they do not change position at the slightest touch.
Should include mats and other basics. This car is completely stripped; one has to buy everything.
 It appears that we are apying for the brand and not much else.

Full Review 
 Hi everybody!!!
I purchased a new Amaze (Petrol) on date 08.06.2014. The car is nice becoz of HONDA name attached with it and few things that i felt was necessary as a third model 1.2 SMT i-vtech are fog lights, driver side door lock key and flexible head rest, MP3 player not available, automatic door lock in only one key and  very important that they gave me the car in just as available condition just after cleaning and without any decoration and ribbons etc. Everybody at home was so disappointed that i cann't tell. I was felling cheated and really bad from inside.
Moreover story is that when i asked for the decoration and ribbons on the new vehicle then the senior person above executive replied that they don't even do anything like this while it was partiality from their side coz i have seen two cars decorated while i was at showroom for sales enquiry a month ago.
I request everybody to take care of their vehicle by themselves or confirm first before delivery coz after delivery they are not gonna listen a single word from ur side coz the caer has sold to u already now bear with it.
The car is nice with few shortcomings as i felt and if i ignore the behaviour of Honda staff which was careless and rude and also made me waited for more than 2 hrs. for delivery even after prior date n time.

Full Review 
Exterior I have spent some 55000 rupees on accessories. The cooling tint having 80 percent UV absorption looks great for the white amaze and also i have included some chrome finish on the handles.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are good and decent but could be better. Te front passengers have the best comfort. The rear passengers do have the comfort but its okay and decent for the small sized sedan.... I would say its not bad.... Having a boot of 400 l a big advantage....
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox When the engine is Honda you dont have to ask for anything or even think about the engine when it comes to Honda petrol engines.
 
Ride Quality & Handling The best part about this car is the ride quality. Its very smooth and quality handling. You can ride smoothly. You can also have a rough ride but you may have to shift gears up and down during overtakes as the rpm and torques are brilliantly packaged and you cant really rely on too much of power or too much of mileage... Its very well balanced to give you the kind of ride quality.
 
Final Words  A good car for a 4 or 5 member family who would like to have a small sedan. People who find it diffficult to drive big cars or who dont have the parking space in their home or people who feel they dont want to spend too much on a complete sedan or people instead of getting a hatch for 5 lakh they can get this lovely car at a reasonably good pricing. if you wanna go with a petrol car and if your budget falls between 5.5-6.5 lakhs then i bet you Amaze is the same bet and its the best for its pricing.....I have added many accessories as i wish for .... Its best to add the accessories which u want rather than going for the higher hand models... Its ok to spend a 50k on accessories to put the right speakers and right accessories which u will use ... For a 1.2 L engine ABS AIRBAGS are not really necessary is your highway usage is not more than 5-6 times per year..... Amaze a wonderful package .....
 
Areas of improvement  I would only ask Honda to improve on the features that they provide along with the vehicle. And the interior looks can be improved and they can by default make chrome finishes by adding a few to the pricing and make the car look even more cooler.... Mileage not an issue but for Indians it is necessary so they can work on that if needed.... Features can be added to make it good....

Exterior Good.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Pooer fule economy.
Ride Quality & Handling Good.
Final Words Honda car is made to be insured by any insurance firm and also asked every owner to take the extended warantee. Is Honda not confident of their quality ? As per the adverisement, it is maintenance free car. The parts damaged can be repleced and the cost will be borne by the insurance company. Then why extended warantee anf isnurance for the car owner ? 
Areas of improvement The mileage is only 14.6 kmpl against promise of 18 kmpl. Visited service centre many times for low mileage. Everytime, they just cleaned the air filter and showed the mileage is 18 kmpl. Daily one can clean the air filter or frequently change the air filter as the Honda cars are maintenance free. It seems the air filter provided in Amaze is faulty. This need to be given more focus by the Honda.

Full Review 
Exterior
 Good, but thin sheet metal used, especially fender is too thin that even by small press it gets bend. Door handles are hard to open, new person opening door feels doors are locked and requests to unlock.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Good space and comfort but power windows have little uneven surface can be felt by human touch and not by naked eyes, small noise comes from dashboard or air vents.  Seat belt always creates creaky noise when riding on bumpy roads. Loose bolts in the boot space, noise from the small cabin space(where small items / dockets are kept) below dashboard on left. The design is pathetic and on bumps creates noise.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
engine  performance is good, but gearbox is way too bad. 1st and 2nd gear are hard to shift and in cold conditions even gets worse
Mileage: 13.5 kmpl in city, 18 kmpl on highway at approx 80kmph speed (Amaze S petrol)
Ride Quality & Handling
Doesn't feel like riding a sedan car. Honda Amaze is a big disappointment.
Safety
No Safety features like no alarm on door lock / unlock 
Final Words
 Honda Amaze has to do a lot in gears transmission, improve quality of parts used. I don't recommend anyone who is particular on minute details of car and more importantly GearBox Transmission of car which I mentioned above
Service
Dealership doesn't accept the problem and always try to convince and the issues are still pending. I reported the gerbox issue and more than 6 months now it is not resolved.
Areas of improvement  
 Gear box Transmission, Improve quality of door handles, fitment of all parts to be proper.

The greatest disappointment for me since the engine is pathetic for PICK UP especially in city rides where you need to have excellent pull while driving in rush hours.
the mileage is hopeless in city drive . I am getting 12 to 13 KMPH even after two servicings
 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Good in manoeuvre especially turning radius . My petrol version is bad in pick up
Final Words
 If you have other option please try OR go for some time tested vehicles like Maruti Dezire. But if you are HONDA fan like me then go for HONDA CITY

Ride Quality & Handling
 Very good ride quality and handling.
Final Words
I have been owning this car for last 1 year and have driven more than 8000 kms, mainly in city and for long drive on weekends. The car performance in city as well as on highways is good. On Highways, it is amazing. The comfort it gives on highways is matchable to any luxury car, like BMWs.
I have been getting mileage of 12-14 in city, depending on traffic and driving. Hyderabad traffic is bad but not so bad as bangalore. so not too much waiting time on trafficlights. Considering an avergae waiting time as 2 mts, the mileage is decent. I travel for around 20 kms everyday (going and coming back from office), so the distances are not very long, and gear shifts are more. What is best about this car is the comfort feeling it provides to the driver, the suspensions are very smooth, tunes to indian potholes. Unless you are driving very rash, there are no heavy jerks to be felt even on bad roads.
The audio player  provides options of FM, aux and USB. No CD player. That hurts a bit, but its also good not to carry many CDs every time you drive. So, i have copied my stuff in a USB. Audio quality is superb. No complaints there. FM quality is also good. AUX I have not uused much as the 3G connection does not seem to be consistent.
Till now, happy with the car performance and the service provided by Honda. Initially I had a problem that car was not picking up well in 2nd gear. Service people checked and suggested that I need to bring the car in 1st gear when on a bumper or going uphill. With that the problem was solved but I was not happy. Next service also I complained the same. After that service, they have some the tuning, and the problem is completely resolved now. Not sure if it is due to tuning or I have got adjusted to the car. But, with time, it seems to be getting better and am enjoying the drives more than before.

Provide CD in Audio player.

 V. Good except the old style music systems nd this also without CD player system. This need to be changed with others like in New Honda City. I think this is only major point to discard. Rear A.C. vent is also needed. Place & style of Port for USB is also very funny. Is mind not applied for  that?
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Best, soundless. Gearbox is also very good.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Easy to drive. Wide window is helpful for lookout the beauty of nature. 
Final Words
 Needed some minor changes which should be, this is good quality car. Boot space is sufficient.
Areas of improvement  
 
As this car is coming in good price range,  the area of interior needs to improve with matching the quality and hence my only strong suggestion to change the music system with latest one with a system for  CD player and port for USB. If there will be provision for rear A.C. vent, this will like CHAAR CHAND.

 Honda pls stop cutting costs by using cheap stuff.Even the battery is chinese made.Wish I had stuck to my Maruti Swift.Honda has always been fitting cheap tyres and batteries which don't last as long as the others.
Areas of improvement  
 Honda is deviating from what it stands for while trying to make cheap cars.Please improve the interior even if it means increasing the cost.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Very responsive engine. What to say about its economy I got 20 kmpl on delhi-gurgaon highway(obviously during non peak traffic time), you can easily get 15kmpl on city roads.
Ride Quality & Handling Very small turning radius you will not feel driving a sedan. Stearing is very smooth.
Final Words Don't even think twice go and buy this. I spent 100 of hrs on internet searching for reviews so believe me its worth spending 6.5lacs+ on this car drove it like 1000 km loving it.
Areas of improvement Air conditioning may need some improvment though its not bad at all but still it may go little inefficient during may and June.

Exterior Very stylish, good road presence
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Quite spacious for rear passengers with good boot space as well, however cheap plastics used in interior. Every time I ride though a bump, the rear view mirror makes an awkward noise.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine as smooth as it can get but the pick up in automatic is not that good. Mileage only 9kpl but since my car is only 400 kms old & first servicing due in another 15 days hopefully it will improve. Also you need to be very light footed on the accelerator to get optimum mileage if you rev the engine hard mileage drops further.
Ride Quality & Handling Quite good & ground clearance will be tested this monsoon when the mumbai roads wear out so this section will be updated post monsoon.
Final Words Good car overall
Areas of improvement Better plastics should have been used in interiors, bluetooth connectivity & auto climate control missing when the other competitors are already providing the same.

Exterior Looks good, Low quality (slender) bumpers and thin sheet of body metal.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good Space and comfort.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Poor pick - up and very difficult on highways. Every time you need to shift to first gerar to get acceleration.
Ride Quality & Handling Good and under control.
Final Words I had a long drive on highways almost 450 kms in a day. The mileage was not as told and as expected. Very poor pick-up, every time need to change to the  first gear to get the acceleration to make the car move faster. I feel, 1200cc is not sufficient for this sedan. Power need to be more for this bold looking car. It is enjoyable to ride in 4th or 5th gerar contineously, but, if you come down in speed, it is difficult to regain.
Areas of improvement Promises not met. Need improvement in power, mileage, quality of body metal and other plastics.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Spacious, comfortable with good leg room
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Relaxing auto tranmission makes it a easy and comfortable drive. noiseless engine and a very light steering makes it a pleasure to drive.
Ride Quality & Handling Smooth. Good suspensions but could have been better.
Final Words Its a value for money car And the only readily avalable auto transmission in this price range. I feel auto transmission is the way to go forward with the kind of traffic we are facing on indian roads.. Appropriately priced in the right segment , where honda has been lacking.
Areas of improvement Air bags should be made a standard accessory as a safety devive on all cars. It would have been great if a sport mode could have been added to th automatic transmission of the vehicle. Rear defogger should be standard also. right corner of the windscreen tends to cause a blind spot.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Basic Interiors but the steering is great to hold and the steering mounted controls are useful. It's very spacious and large glasses gives it a very airy feel. Seats are comfortable, look premium and height adjustment for driver seat helps you find a good position.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is spirited at low RPM however is a bit sluggish in speeds btw 60-80 kmph. Overall, a very comfortable drive in city. I am getting a mileage of around 12 kmph in Mumbai compared to around 10 kmph which I used to get with my swift.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality and handling is good and suspension is bit on the softer side but has never scraped the speed breakers
Final Words A very comfortable ride in city traffic
Areas of improvement Interiors could have been better but looks like cost considerations were paramount. Can't complain much because you are getting a 3 box automatic car for 8 lakhs.

Exterior Lookwise it is good but as per my likings it should be sleek like city ground clearence is ok but if increased well and good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is not very attractive stereo not impressive supports only MP3, space is good, comfortable specially seat postion is very comfortable but left side vision is poor without side mirror, ride is very comfortable while in city as well as long routes. No tiredness.
 Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Gears are very smooth, no need to use clutch at low speed engine is noise less. I am using petrol model. fuel economy is very good on long route I got 19.6 kmpl/lit. in city it varies from 12 to 15 depends on your driving culture.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent.
Final Words Till date I am satisfied with the car except its horn  and headlight bulb failed but replaced by the dealer.
Areas of improvement Interior plus stereo.

I started looking for a car last September, I started driving at 22 and have owned three cars all maruti suzuki 800 simply I wanted a peace of mind car . When finally at 40 I thought of looking beyond maruti brand I was amazed at the choice I had .I won’t say any car is lessor than other but I was looking for peace of mind car and I wanted a petrol car even when I drive 2k kms every month diesel was never my choice . anyway after many test drives and consultation I selected Honda Brio just coz I luved the looks and of course it is a peace of mind car and last week I went to book it at prestige Honda Chandigarh, while talking the sales Ex . I started talking about amaze and the more I talked about it the more I liked it. it had all the looks all the space and Honda I-vtec under hood And I decided this is one I wanted and finalized 1.2 SMT @ 6.7 all inclusive except regiistration which will cost another 50k approx . gave him cheque and picked the car next day .I have driven 1400 kms in 8 days, I have drove it in B2B traffic I have drove it on highway and trust me its amazing .Its rock solid . its silent . its aggressive and in 5500 rs wroth of petrol it have travelled 1425 kms that’s an   amazing mileage of 19km/l:)

Full Review 
Exterior
 I love the exterior make, strong and sturdy for the price.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 very spacious for 5 passengers(including driver). No one has complained so far even when driver's seat is pulled out maximum to back. Dials looks very out dated, there is no "wow" factor at all.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 I have had a very bad experience in this aspect. I use Air conditioning all the time. So it can be because of that but on a highway I have got just 14-15 kmpl and in city I experience the worst, just 10-12kmpl!!. This is definitely not something I had in mind while buying this car. I was misguided by the fuel efficiency and qouted milage of 18kmpl. Also the engine seems to be tuned for maximum efficiency or something because of which the uphills which I used to very easily  climb on 2nd or 3rd gear in my previous car is no more possible. I am forced to shift down to 1st(more often) or 2nd gear for the same uphills now. I find it terribly irritating.
When it comes to gearbox, I have drove cars with way smoother gear transition.
Ride Quality & Handling
 With this price one cant expect too comfy seatings right?. So if you are making a journey say of 3 hours, better take a pit stop in between if you dont want to end up with a back pain. Steering the vehicle is comfortable but when you are finding a tough spot in a congested parking lot, you would wish steering were a bit more smooth.
Final Words
 This car is for the average person who loves to own a decent car from a legacy brand. However dont trust on the milage qouted by the company in their advertisements. No matter how well you drive you will not get it. If you are driving in a very traffic congested place, then I won't recommend this model of Amaze to you. 
Areas of improvement  
 Nothing other than on the fuel efficiency and engine tuning.

Full Review 
Exterior
Simple amazing style and a unique one. Front part looks pretty similar to Brio. It gives a bold look on the outside.
 Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space and comfort best in class in this segment. Features needs to be improved to make it more competitive to the other brands.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance and gearbox best the very best i have seen so far. Unmatchable to other brands. This simple has the best performance overall.
Mileage can be improved a bit but still i feel it gives a great performance considering the power of 88ps. and it also delivers a good mileage when compared to other competitors.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality and handling again i feel its a better overall package. Only the pick up might disappoint you but once it crosses a particular rpm you will feel the vehicle is amazing and simply superb.
I clocked 140-150 kmph consistently without any difficulty inspite of the boot being fully packed and there was no vibration inside the cabin and trust me i feel honda has limited the top speed of amaze petrol engine to max of 150kmph(indian conditions). A good decent mileage considering the speed that i clocked consistenly. Breaks were good. I dont find them faulty or unresponsive. Clutch response is really good.
Final Words Getting a basic model and adding up the accessories makes some sense because the features that they provide is not that satisfying. Airbags is not really necessary as its just a 1.2 L engine and the stereo system that the company provides is not that great. Alloys you can have your personal choice. So honda needs to give more colour options even for the basic model and needs some serious features that can be added just to make it more competitive. to mention a few, Reae wiper,Automatic climate control, centre arm rest etc.
Areas of improvement Features and interiors needs some serious improvement and it needs to stay a class apart from Brio and make it very competitive to its rivals DZIRE and XCENT. I dont think others can compete well enough with the likes of INDIGO,Ford Classic and Fiat Classic and ETIOS. Although they are more powerful, i feel Amaze,Dzire and Xcent can be compared. The horn of Amaze the default one looks like a toy horn. I have made a lot of updates to make it look like a 7-8 Lakh car. For Brio being a small car thats fine, thats definitely not acceptable for Amaze. There should be some difference in the features that we get in Amaze for sure. Atleast 90 ps power and some features or 1.3L engine. Just giving few thousands more just for the boot is not acceptable.

Full Review 
This is my experience of the first 1000kms of the new 1.2 VX I purchased in Bangalore. The dealership of Whitefield Honda are right up there with their service. 
I read a lot about how to break in the car on various blogs and website and took appropriate steps. To beging with I have so far used Shell Premium for my three tank fills for the 1000Kms. Needless to say that the calculator on the mileage front has not been so exciting. However, experts and the dealership say that I should be getting the optimum mileage only after the services 1st/1000Km, 3rd/5K Km and 6th/10K Kms. I did check the mileage on short trip and at an average with the AC on almost all the time, the returned mileage reading was 12-13kmpl. 
After running the car in the gruelling traffic of bangalore, i decide to take the drive on the highway to mysore and back. Needless to say, the car performed as per expectations. The drive was excellent and the overall mileage returned for the trip was 15Kmpl. The car although did return a 17.8kmpl in early morning dash to office (indiranagar to whitefield via OMR). So am still enthused for good readings to come.
I have realised the following in my drives, that the ECO light really helps optimize the efficiency. The more you drive with the light on, the better efficiency you get. The drive of the Amaze has been superior with a stable road handling and good steering feedback. The short turning radius is a boon in peak city traffic. The AC performs well when you are cruising, however there is a difference in the rear  cabin and the blower really needs to be turned to full for even cooling. The music system too is well packaged within the cabin and really did not feel the need for another new set. The bluetooth integration is sorely missed. 
The car feels a bit underpowerd in the 3rd and 4th gear during uphill climbs. One really has to press the pedal to get some power going. At 40kmph, I would have expected the power delivery on 3rd and 4th gear to be smooth. Don't know if this is specific to this car or with all users. Another feature which is sorely missed, is the rear windshield wiper. With the monsoon kicking in, the visibility is really affected. May be a rain repellant coat would help. The car smoothly takes in most of the potholes our Indian roads offer and rear passengers are in total comfort. The noise is practically zero under idling conditions and very minimal when running in on highways. Honda has really masted the NVH in the petrol version. 
My first service is around the corner and hope to post some more experience till the next one happens.
Happy Revving!!

I have been owning this car for last 1 year and have driven more than 8000 kms, mainly in city and for long drive on weekends. The car performance in city as well as on highways is good. On Highways, it is amazing. The comfort it gives on highways is matchable to any luxury car, like BMWs.
I have been getting mileage of 12-14 in city, depending on traffic and driving. Hyderabad traffic is bad but not so bad as bangalore. so not too much waiting time on trafficlights. Considering an avergae waiting time as 2 mts, the mileage is decent. I travel for around 20 kms everyday (going and coming back from office), so the distances are not very long, and gear shifts are more. What is best about this car is the comfort feeling it provides to the driver, the suspensions are very smooth, tunes to indian potholes. Unless you are driving very rash, there are no heavy jerks to be felt even on bad roads.
The audio player  provides options of FM, aux and USB. No CD player. That hurts a bit, but its also good not to carry many CDs every time you drive. So, i have copied my stuff in a USB. Audio quality is superb. No complaints there. FM quality is also good. AUX I have not uused much as the 3G connection does not seem to be consistent.
Till now, happy with the car performance and the service provided by Honda. Initially I had a problem that car was not picking up well in 2nd gear. Service people checked and suggested that I need to bring the car in 1st gear when on a bumper or going uphill. With that the problem was solved but I was not happy. Next service also I complained the same. After that service, they have some the tuning, and the problem is completely resolved now. Not sure if it is due to tuning or I have got adjusted to the car. But, with time, it seems to be getting better and am enjoying the drives more than before.

Exterior The car looks very good from the outside. The two lines on the outside extending to the end looks classy. And also parking this car is not an issue as we do not have a lot of parking space in Kolkata roads.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) There is a lot of space in the inside. Although the plastics, sound system etc could have been been made better. A lot of people had written about the Music System, but it suites my purpose since I do not use it in a loud volume to hear the horns of the cars behind me. There is also a 12v DC socket to charge your phones and other uses. But the wire to hook up the USB pen drive looks a bit odd in the inside near your foot. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Have ridden the car for almost 150 Kms. Bought it on 31/10/2015. Engine pick up is a bit slow initially but once the RPM is pushed to 2000, then the pick up is great and overtaking in city traffic is easy. Not yet tested on the highway as of now. But engine noise as well as AC fan noise is filtering inside the cabin. Have to get it looked at in the first servicing. Fuel economy shows 10 km/l in the meter provided. Too early to comment on the same.
Ride Quality & Handling Since the suspension is new, the potholes are not felt. Lets see how long this comfort lasts.
Final Words For a person like me who commutes may be 50-60 kms per day, it is a good buy. The reason why I bought this car is because I used a Maruti for the last 11 years (4 years in a Zen and 7 years in a Swift). I wanted to change the brand and see and since the Honda showroom is one of the showrooms near to my house, went for the Amaze. Could not afford a City and also it would not have fit in my garage.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) - Space is outstanding, plastics used inside are cheap in quality and complete dashboard is outdated in terms of morden era.(the buttons are look like old radio buttons etc.......
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox - gearbox is little bit getting jam but no issue.....fuel economy is very gud.Over al performance is like matching the intuition as it comes true.
 
Ride Quality & Handling - solid, justified fun to drive.
 
Final Words - very gud but focous to be generated for interior dashboard though HONDA is following "Machine minimum ; Man maximum"
 
Areas of improvement  - dashboard, plastic quality which are used and mainly buttons.
 
 Whether u may help me in my desiring fields such as dashboard & buttons ets.......

Exterior
 
Good looking but Exterior metal is thin and should improve..
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 
Simple. Can Honda give more than this in such price
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 
Space, Fuel Economy (I am getting 16 km in city - Driving from Ghaziabad to Noida). Last month went to high and got 19 Km per h. But yes i drived between 80-90 km/hr.
 
Gearbox: smooth
 
Engine: Most of the time ...no noise.
 
Ride Quality & Handling
 
Easy & simple. You will enjoy loving it
 
Lot of people mentioned about low clearance but I could not found any issue till now. 
 
Final Words
 
I have compared lot of cars (Zest, Dzire etc) before i made the decision. I will say go for it.
 
I liked the Honda feedback follow up. They took at multilevel's. 
 
Areas of improvement
 
Exterior metal is thin even fom small push panel will get dant

Exterior
 I love those headlights and the taillighits.  A proper saloon car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 The touch screen display on the dashboard is an optional, which I didn't like, space and comfort, a class apart. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Gearbox responds well, fuel economy: reliable, engine performance: I loved it, it is very silent.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Makes a lot of cabin noise at high speeds, but is dominated by the Amaze's light and accurate steering.
Final Words
 It is a proper saloon car. It has a proper boot, great roadside assistance. I don't understand why car experts think the Hyundai Xcent is a better car than the Amaze. Just because the Xcent has got a attractive dashboard and a CD-player which the Amaze hasn't, its stupid because what you really care is that the car drives smoothly. And the Xcent looks cramped than the Amaze.
Areas of improvement  
The cabin noise. If Honda does reduce the cabin noise, it would be perfect. And for the CD player, its useless because the Amaze has got a Bluetooth System and the USB portal, and if a person has a car, he obviously has a phone through which you can download songs and just play them on the stereo. The Honda enginners did thought about this, and because they are very clever, they decided to opt out the CD system, which could have incresed the weight if the car and reduced its efficeincy.

Final Words: I got an accident on 1st of November evening and immediately took it to workshop ( Kaikan Ford) on very next day morning. From the workshop they said as the car is new so they don't have all the spare parts so it will take 3 days to get them. When till 12th the spare parts didn't arrive I had lodged a complaint to Ford India. Ford India's Customer relation person Husna Banu took my case and promised to update me from time to time which she never did. Just when dealership on 17th afternoon received the spare parts then she called to say it will reach in the evening where as matter of fact the parts actually reached workshop. Then on 18th I received the car and the workshop guys honestly told me that one part is still missing and they have fixed the accident affected part till the time the part arrive so that I can use the car till that time. 
After that Husna Banu called next day that if I am happy with the dealer's repair work, without knowing that still they are waiting for a part from Ford India. When I told her that she promised to look after the matter and again vanished. Till date no reply for my mails not even a call to update me when the part will arrive, if I call they say trying their best without giving a concrete answer. It's 25 days since I took the car to Ford workshop. Please think twice before purchasing a Ford Product. Very sorry to say that too much incompetent people they have employed.

Exterior Excellent.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Well spacious.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox New car should be driven atleast 3000kms
Ride Quality & Handling Gear shifting is smooth, engine response is good. City handling is also good.
Final WordsSimply awesome. Just effortless, you wont get tired driving this car. Drive even at 140 Km/hr and you wont even know at what speed you are at.
Final Words After all we are all buying a car for the Engine and the safety, others are all useless. In this aspect I chose to buy Ford figo aspire, becoz the company provides 100Ps engine and 2 Airbags in all variants. Trend 1.2 litrs figo aspire petrol .good sedan car,.the starting power need to be improved,lighting need to be improved,they use 55/60, atleast 100/90 to be made.spaces car.abs need to be given in basic  variant.good value for moneny happy motering
Areas of improvement Kindly provide bottle holder for rear seats.kindly improve the power of lights.

Exterior 
There is no comparison when it comes to the exteriors...very contemporary design. The front look is very good and gives a very premium feel. The nose is just gorgeous and the lines across the bonnet gives a muscular feel as well.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) 
Descent features, awesome space and very comfortable. The music system is very good and the sound is descent enough.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 
Feels a bit low of power in lower revs, fuel economy is descent. The gearbox feels good and does the job.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Superior ride quality and very good handling. Negotiating curves on this car is fun. Did a long drive covering almost 2000 kms and it was a breeze driving the car on highways. Handled very well even at high speeds of above 140kmph.
Final Words
 Excellent car from Ford India. Hope the car buyers get out of the craze for maruti suzuki cars and try something new which is far superior than the competition
Areas of improvement  
 Better fitting optional seat covers, ABS on lower versions. Cup holders on the rear seat arm rest. A little more horse power to do the hard work. :D

Exterior
 (BABY ASTON MARTIN FRONT)best exterior it has got finest finish one can expect, it is a nice car, quality is good, paint quality good solid bosy and sturdy, the finish is imp[eccable in the price range 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 feature are full the only thing i feel missing is centre ceiling light at the back
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 engine performance is something which is boast of more refined than dezire and amaze(used both of them and sold them), engine is solid with peppy r.p.m reacher drove 1000 kms without break from faridabad to ujjain took some 18 hours to reach there 2 hour stoppage you can judje for yourself( 4 cylinder will make it zip, compare to 3 cylinder of xcent and more power than amaze and dezire respectively.
Ride Quality & Handling
ride quality is something which is best in vehicle bumpy roads no worry, potholes never feels tham, overall it feels driving a 10 lakh sedan
suspension are smooth and bumpy rides are unfelt 
 
Final Words
buy this car if you want full VFM, i found it above dezire,xcent and amaze(used and sold all 3 in last 4 years)
 
Areas of improvement  
none as such diggi space(boot space) is fine also, quality is there is every angle and aspect, sturdy car and too, looks are like a sports car( aston martin)
they should only privide centre ceiling light only, rest everything it has
 door locks should have darts-safety point of view
mine is titanium petrol- city average(13), highway(16)

Exterior Excellent look. It does not look like a low cost car. Front chrome grills are awesome.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Decent interior, good leg space. rear seats are also okay. good leg room in rear but poor thigh support.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Not bad, good for city driving. On highway you have to limit the speed. It cannot accelerate quickly beyond 100 km/hr speed. So other vehicles will be overtaking you. Gear shifting is smooth. 2nd gear again does not give the expected acceleration. You may have to come to first gear while moving on gradients you will get embarrassed.
Ride Quality & Handling Good ride quality and handling,however there is a good amount of body roll and it is annoying.
Final Words A good car for short distance  city drive.  The look is awesome, but don’t expect the performance of a high end sedan. You have to remember that it is a low cost sedan. Don’t buy the IRVM with video display from ford. It cannot display anything during day time due to glare. It is very expensive also.
Areas of improvement Could have change the tyre to 15 inches. Alloys coming with ford are old fashioned.
Ford has to improve the customer service. So far received pathetic service from ford. Unless they improve this aspect, they cannot sell much.

I bought this car on Nov 27th and have driven over 2k till now. Overall the car is well designed in terms of looks, features and space. 
 
Except for rear seat thigh support. 
 
Exterior
 
Good ground clearance. looks. Alignment of bonnet, doors, squeaking doors.  The body just goes in, even when a kid pushes the door or bonnet. Does not feel sturdy. No CD/DVD player.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 
 Not enough rear thigh support. No 1 ltr bottle bolder.  Squeaking doors and minor rattling around even in a slightly bumpy road. 
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 
 Sometimes it feels the engine revs more than the power output. The automatic takes off with a rev when pressed feels good to floor the peddle, no lag in gear change. With 17 kmpl fuel economy is good on highway.  
 
Ride Quality & Handling
 
Feels the suspension transfers some part of bumps to the cabin. Rear thigh support makes it hard for long drive for taller passengers.  The handling is pretty good and this is a driver’s car.
 
Final Words
 
Though well-conceived, the build quality of car is very poor. It was not what was expected from ford. The doors and bonnets are miss aligned.
 
Feels the material used not up to the mark. When closing the window the door shakes and moves because of power motors
 
Areas of improvement  
 
Build quality, and  read thigh support.

Exterior Crunchy grills will add muscular looks to vehicle
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Seats are very comfort. Ample leg room for both front and rare. Interior colors are perfectly matched. Two air bags right from basic model good safty features.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Petrol Engine little under performed when using AC, Real power will be emitted after 2 gear. Engine is very smooth. I drove for about 2300 km till now since I bought on Nov-2015, so enthusiastic to drove for long drives.
Noiseless-you not even identify whether engine is ON/OFF.
Mileage-16.5 on highway with AC ON
Speaker quality can be improved
Ample boot space 360L
Transmission tunnel can be made flat ,will make third passenger in rear even comfort
Ride Quality & Handling Streeling responses very well ,espicially on edges. Engine is very smooth you hardly hear the noise.
Final Words Good vehicle.Offered premium feature in mid range itself
Areas of improvement Seat height adjust required from basic model. Right vision issue to be fixed. Can be improved in power for petrol engine vehicle. Wiper in back window. Parking sensors much needed.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) No Issues. Its really nice and comfortable!

Final Words Its one of my long awaited Car. Somthing we need to sacrifice. I am a ford lover, so milage surely i have to Ignore and Pickup with 1.2 engine + Sadan it was expected.  So no complaints. I am enjoying it!! Love you ford! 
Areas of improvement Areas yes compared with Ford Figo vs Aspire. 1.2 is fine PS could have been increased.I have done the 1st free service. Fuel economy can be a issue. May be coz I am driving it within city limit!I have done the 1st free service. Fuel economy can be a issue. May be coz I am driving it within city limit!

Exterior The front end is really Aston Martin inspired with a lot of muscle packed in the the snout but the rear seems abruptly cut off due the the sub 4 meter class tag. Build quality send sturdy with lesser plastic all around.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors look signature ford style. Audio is great. Interior finishing is smooth with black and bright contours.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Petrol 1.2 litre engine is not enough to blow a storm when the gas is floored but response is good and engine nose is not noticeable unless you Rev it real hard.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling is a little on the heavier side and the turning radius almost as that of a hatchback. As far as city driving is concerned, potholes are brushed aside with ease. The car makes its run for the cash especially on open highways.
Final Words Will love the car and its performance if not looking for a motoring extravagance. Better than any other sub 4 meter sedan in Indian roads currently.
Areas of improvement Power output of the ending needs to be improved and improved throttle responsiveness can be a great addition to future models of the car.

A MILD RESEMBLANCE OF VISTA, INDICA IN FRONT


Full Review 
Exterior Front portion looks similar to indica, vista.A look from either sides, the chrome finsihed strip on the windows  would make it  difficult to judge and tell if the car is from tata or any other expensive brand, boot on the rear is nicely integrated, the led lights on the rear, gives a expensive car look alike to BMW or mercedes.The front lights are corona rings which a impossible to find in any other competitors in this segment, barring the look of vista n indica, manza, i simply love the overall design. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Audio system by Harman is mind blowing, 8 speakers in built make it mind blowing.The AC is uniform and chilling within few minutes, controls on steering are easy to access, except for the horn for which easy accessibility needs to be improved, hard to reach out while driving, Good finish and good quality materials used in the cabin bulit, mice insulated cabin which makes hard to guess to such a level that it is difficult to tell if the engine is in on or off mode(petrol), 3 can sit on the rear without any issue at all and good leg room no problem on long journeys at all, the air bags are included only for 7 lakhs on road for both driver seat  and copassenger makes it a safe car, in bulit security alarm is cool and secure, SUSPENSION IS GOOD, IMPACT IS HARDLY FELT INSIDE.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The new revetron is cool no lag whatsoever, 15 is not bad at all on highways and I get 13.5 to 14 in city, gerbox has no issues when switched smoothly which full clutch pressed while shifting gears.
Ride Quality & Handling The car feels stable and planted even at high speeds, the steering commmunicates well with the driver and makes him feel that he is well in control of the car. The ABS+EBD+CS makes it an advance featured car in this segment, infact you cant find all the three in a single built car not even in honda amaze, xcent or swift or sunny or honda city.
Final Words I booked first the Xcent , later during my test drive came across this superb car on August 12, 2014.Though to check the Zest, After all the claims Tata  was making eg: improved customer service, better on road assistance, knowledegable people who really know abt the vehicle, Good customer service on the first go, when I took test drive i couldnt believe i was riding a tata vehicle, I choose to dump all the negative feedback i heard abt Tata for years and indeed TATA WITH THE ARRIVAL OF ZEST ARE WALKING THE TALK!!! I THEN COMPARED XCENT MID VARIANT PETROL WHICH WAS 6, 47,000 ON ROAD AND THE NEW ZEST WHICH WAS 7,00,000 XT HIGH END, THEN REALIZED THAT I FELT I WAS CHEATED BY HYUNDAI, NOT HAVING INCLUDED AIR BAGS,MANY MORE FEATURES. IMMEDIATELY WENT TO HYUNDAI AND CANCELLED THE BOOKING AND WENT AHEAD WITH THE ZEST, NOW THAT IS CALLED WORTH FOR YOUR MONEY....TATA HATZ OFF TO YOU, AND I AM PROUD AN INDIAN BUILT IS OFFERING SUCH A SUPERB PRODUCT FOR THE BEST PRICE..... I LOVE MY ZESTT.
Areas of improvement MAKE THE HORN EASILY ACCESSIBLE, IF POSSIBLE MAKE THE FRONT LOOK UNIQUE AND NOT MATCHING WITH ANY TATA VEHICLE, BETTER FINISH FOR UNDER THE 4 CAR DOORS.

I was looking out for a compact sedan and dared to check out Zest. Have driven it for about 600 km now and I still ask myself is this really Tata!
Exterior Zest looks good..if not the best in compact sedan category.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Had heard a lot about poor quality interiors of Tata cars…but couldn’t complain a bit on this for Zest. Touch screen music system, steering mounted controls with voice commands excellent. Good second row space for three people, head room for six footers the quality of material and dash board (is this Tata?) Impressive. Zest is loaded with practical features check them out.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Gearshifts, pick up, clutch - good. It has delivered 14 kmpl in city.
Ride Quality & Handling It’s fun to drive. 15 inch alloy for all variants- big thumbs up
Final Words I was about to buy Xcent. But changed to Zest. It has proved a worthy buy for me and yes it is a Tata car. Best VFM car.
Areas of improvement After sales service. I hope that perception will change too!

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Reverse gear sometimes create problem, remaining every thing is ver smooth, after stopping the engine the fan to cool the engine starts automatically and stops automatically. when you put the machine in the sports mode, the acceleration is fantastic.
Ride Quality & Handling Awesome, teriffic, you can drive it upto 120km/h with nearly zero sound coming from the engine.
Final Words Good car , i am loving it, just drive, enjoy the music and chill in ac, it is a good car from tata motors, which is going to give tough competition to etios,xcent,desire and lastly the sail.
Areas of improvement Customer service, the sales persons are the most illeterate of t.c.motors, howrah. Still now i havent went to the service centre dont know wat terror is waiting there.

Exterior
I am totally amazed at how Tata Zest have been designed and yes when it’s on road people does check it out.  Back lit Tail LED , Front engine bonnet and high ground clearance make it look  very impressive. Most of the guys don’t believe at first, Zest being a Tata Brand. :) 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
While Driving I get two ways to adjust myself by adjusting Length and height of the seat. The seats are really comfortable as Tata has signified the presence of shoulder hugging seats and yes it does make the interior look nice. About back seats you get enough leg space to be at your comfort. With Airbags ,Safety is ensured but I would have preferred side airbags also.  Dashboard comprises of Infotainment which has call reject/accept feature which I find it very useful while driving accepting a call while driving and the controls are on steering wheel. Sound system is nice. Cabin as whole is very pretty and comfortable.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 With three engine mode you have the ability to pace at your own way. I have driven City and sprts mode and yes it makes a huge difference when you drive in sports mode. You get power while pickup. I felt the boost while driving in sports mode and in city/Eco its normal and they are all about fuel efficiency.
Ride Quality & Handling
I would attribute my ride quality as very smooth due to high ground clearance .One can run over bumps how high it might be. Even with bumpy roads you feel very less shake inside the cabin. 
Final Words
Overall verdict is Excellent . I liked the car very much myself driving , styling, comfort and best part was sports mode. I would definitely recommend to my friends who either loves fuel economy or power. 
Areas of improvement  
Clutch changing could have been more smooth. 
Engine compartment coverage from mud.

Exterior New Styling, very good Looks.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) All within reach, spacious enough for three well built adults in the rear, pleasure to drive.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Responsive engine, when you switch modes on the fly. shift to the sport mode and you feel the power rush underneath.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent.
Final Words Anyone thinking of a Compact Sedan, should take a drive and then finalise.
Areas of improvement There is always room for improvement, a technician would have found some, could not find any.
The overall experience was good, though this a new product launch, the staff was very courteous and eager to assist you. Have visited other brand showrooms with new product lauches, where the staff is arrogance personified, nobody willing to answer. Tata Motors (concorde) have done a wonerful job, to train the staff to be helpful. Am going to buy this Car very soon.

Exterior Looks jazzy and young. Specially the Daytime running lights and LED tail lamps gives it a luxury look. Resembles standard Tata signature from the front but completely new from the back.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Seats are very comfortable and as its from Tata its very spacious. There are many first and best in class features specially the touch screen and voice recognition based infotainment system of 8 speakers surround sound effect. Voice recognition is very effective even for normal Indian accent. The cabin is completely insulated from noise and you feel completely cut-off from outside.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is very quite specially from inside because of best insulated cabin. The power and pickup is great because of the turbocharged engine. Infact, it can compete with cars of higher segment in engine performance. Fuel economy is not that good. Its giving me just 12.5 km/l with full AC on, in city and traffic jam conditions. On highway with AC, it gave me 15 km/l. Fuel economy increases in Eco mode of the engine which works with reduced power and pickup.
Ride Quality & Handling Very smooth and comfortable ride quality and easy handling.
Final Words Its an excellent car with features beating the cars of even the higher segment of Honda City / Hyundai Verna. Its power and pickup are better than all competitors including DZire, Amaze and Xcent. Its space and comfort is also better than all competitors. And its price is lesser than all competitors, even lesser than some premium hatchbacks like I20 Elite. I don't think any logical person will find a better car than Zest. Only if you go by the brand name perceptions, you should buy any other car. Otherwise, this is the best car.
Areas of improvement Tata's engineers should research and find out. I could not do that.

I think people on this forum are all talking good about the car. I own XMS petrol version for past 2.5 months now and I have driven it 1500 kms. I just got my first servicing done & had following problems,
1) The gear shifting was so difficult that it seemed to me that I am driving a truck. They 'reconditioned shifting mechanism' in the first service to resolve this issue. I still feel that its not upto the mark.
2) Car would switch off while the engine is cold while shifting gears. This is really annoying when you are driving in crowded & steep roads. In the first servicing they changed, 'relay sockets'. 
3) The front window would not close properly. They changed rubber beading for it. 
4) The gear stick would vibrate badly, especially on 3rd gear. - The service center said it will remain like this. 
Overall, I am not very satisfied with the performance. The mileage is 10km/l. The eco mode has so bad pickup that even buses & trucks would pass you while you are trying to accelerate. I have driven a Hyundai car for past 5 years and never had these problems which I faced in first 3 months of my drive with Tata Zest. Overall, I would rate the car 2/5.

Exterior Looks is decent and modern. gives suv like feeling. Rear view is excellent with led light. 18 spokes alloy wheel gives sporty look in lower trim better than top end alloy wheel. i specially liked the projector headlamp which  gives uniform light. Looks will allure modern buyers.

Final Words Great vfm compact sedan for young ones who wants to switch from hatchbacks.
Areas of improvement Height adjustable driver seatand rear parking sensors should be kept standard .at leat space for 4 bottle holders should be provided.

Full Review 
I purchased this car after reading all new commitments TATA was making to work on changing their impression in Corporate and Individual Car buyers. Heard TATA has launched a complete new generation car at a very affordable price. It has also hired a new team across India to provide a new definition to the work Customer Service.
I placed my faith on their confidence and went ahead & booked the car by changing my mind in the last min from other options that i was considering earlier.
After lot of hassles with the dealer i finally got delivery of my car in Dec'14. To my surprise i was given car with only 1/2 ltr of petrol in tank during delivery. I realised it when i reached National Highway with my family after driving 5 kms and got stuck in the middle of road in night 8PM. After 2-3  hr of personalordeal I finally reached home somehow as the delaer expressed a sorry figure and said he wont be able to help at this time.
Next day i felt some performance issue with the car so took the car to workshop. Came to know that 2 out of 4 sparkplugs in the car were faulty which were replaced. a Week later i came to know there was an issue with the car sensor and door lock which was again repaired.
Right from first week i kept pointing out that the car's mileage is very poor (around 9.5 in city drive). Even after 3 more separate visit to workshop on same issue the problem remained to be same. I even met some more ZEST owners in TATA's Maha Service Campaigns last month, who too were suffering due to mileage (around10-12 customers).
Nd inspite of repeated check up's by the Workshop their engineer are not able to find the root cause and have given me a sorry figure for an excuse.
TATA inspite of their various claims and promises have yet again failed to deliver a good car to the customers. Doubt it would do any better if launched in commercial either. Here is a sign of yet another ventuer of TATA which has only left customer like us crying for spending a fortune.

Exterior  The design of the zest is notch above others. The Projector headlamps, LED tail lamp gives it a very sporty look. The fit and finish had been improved. The tata motors are back in the game. All the variants come with sporty alloy wheels of set of 4.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)  Step inside the zest and you will be pleasently surprised. The interiors doesn't let you feel that you are sitting in a tata car. Specially the Harman touchscreen infotainment system with voice recognition give the car a feature rich background. The voice recognition system recognizes words of indian accent also. Thanks to the 3 sound insulating layers which makes the cabin very quiet. The Dashboard is inspired by the Jaguar interiors. If you want to see the video demonstration of the voice command based infotainment system then click below:
http://youtu.be/21HtvirgKq8
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox  The revotron engine is much powerfull. In sports mode, the acceleration is the best. The fuel economy is good, but best in quadrajet (diesel). The gearbox is smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling  The ride quality is very nice. You will not feel much jerks. The handling is also nice.
Final Words  The car is best in its segment. This car is better that its competitors like swift dzire, Xcent, Amaze, Etios and Sail. This car is fully loaded with best features most of which doesn't exists in its compititors. I advice you to buy this car instead of other cars like amaze, dzire, xcent, sail, etc. Be Indian buy indian. This car pleased me a lot. The most thing i like in this car is its voice command based infotainment system and the 8 speakers surround effect. This is a best car to buy at lower price with a lot of inbuilt features. This is a great car to own.
Areas of improvement  Tata Motors are a huge step forward by launching this car. This car is a game changer for tata motors. The Fit and finish has also been improved.

To everyone who is planning to buy Zest, please read this for one time before you even think of going ahead with your purchase.
 I Purchased the car XT Petrol in Dec 2014.  
Since February, steering wheel of car is not self centering at slow speeds when starting off. Tata plant team "certifies" that there is no problem in car after 8 visits to the workshop, once for 8 days at a stretch.
 Car was in service center for 8 days for above problem, new problem introduced - driver seat started giving creaking noise. Tata says it is repairable but we will replace as a special case.
 Handbrake was not working on slopes with even just 2 passengers, had to get it fixed.
 AC stopped working one day, started working by itself the next day at workshop, Tata found everything ok so according to them there is no problem.
 Reverse parking sensor sounds suddenly stopped and then started working suddenly.
 Sudden automatic horn when locking with remote key one day - for precisely 30 minutes. Then went off by itself.
 Boot spring became stiff in less than 2 months, service advisor insisted that it is normal wear and tear, had to get it fixed in front of me.
 Driver side sun visor was vibrating badly, service advisor insisted that it is same on all zests, had to pursue to get it replaced.
 Rattling noise in dashboard - had to get 3 service center visits to get it fixed.
 DRLs stopped working suddenly, Tata motors gave me "logic" to start them if they stop working.
 Don't even ask about mileage.
 Trust me you will have a hard time.

Exterior The car has great looks specially from the front left or right side and I was impressed at first view.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The space offered is the best in segment. Features such as Airbags and ABS was a definite requirement for me when I went car shopping. In addition it has Harman music system with 8 speakers which was so far available in premium sedan cars. The comfort it offers is indeed incomparable to the ones in this segment.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance so far has been good and I am actually impressed with the fuel economy. I have read reveiws from several people that the FE they get from Petrol version is around 9 to 10 but I think it depends directly on the way one drives. If you start from standstill with full throttle and use brake and accelerate too many times, then FE is obviously going to suffer. It is not a Tata Zest problem. As fa as I am concerned, when I took the delivery of car, the display was 9.2 KMPL, however over a period of close to 1000 KM now, the display is 15.4 KMPL without first service being done yet. On some trips, I have also got a max of 19.2 KMPL with gentle foot on the throttle. So FE is very subjective IMO.
About gearbox, I sometimes feel jerks when downshifting from 5th to 4th or 4th to 3rd  in case I have to pick up speed. The gear handle is sometimes too hard and vibrates ocassionally. This is the only niggle I can say.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is just perfect with the super light steering which make driving a very enjoyabke experience. 
Final Words Have tried all the compact sedans by comparing the specs as well as test drives and I feel Zest is the Value for money car. Yes agree that dealership expereince is bad, but then I think what is important here is the product rather than packaging. Go for it.
Areas of improvement Dealerships needs to be a bit responsive and focus on customers. Times are changing and Tata must keep up pace and get their dealers to deliver. 
Overall the product is too good.

Exterior VERY ATTRACTIVE EXTERIOR, IT GIVES A PLEASANT FEELING. TATA SIGNATURE GRILLE WITH AN UNIQUE HUMANITY LINE. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) It is outfitted with body- hugging rugby shoulders seats and best in class interior space which makes long drive a pleasure.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Revotron engine is good. it is noise free. I have got an average of 14 with ac in city. Gear box is also good.
Ride Quality & Handling The ride quality  is excellent. it gives a pleasure on long drive.
Final Words I HAVE BOOKED ZEST XMS ON 29/08/2014 AT RANCHI.BUT STILL I AM WAITING FOR DELIEVERY. ALL OF THE SALES STAFF HAD COMMITED ME THAT YOU GOT IT ON 29/09/14 . BUT STILL I FEEL BOTHERD BY THESE PERSONS.
Areas of improvement I HAVE HEARD ONE OF MY WELL WISHERS BEFORE BOOKING  THAT TATA IS POOR IN SERVICE(PRE & POST) AND NOW I AM BOTHERING. YA THAT IS 100% TRUTH AND COMPANY PROVES THAT TATA HINDI MEANS BYE BYE AND The Company IS MOVING FORWARD ON THIS PATH.

Full Review 
I was looking to buy a car and I have checked several time on carwale, compared swift, amaze, grand I 10, etios and more.  When I was checking On road price the price was getting little high as my on road budget was around 6 Lakh, and I was missing some feature like alloy wheel, airbags.
When Zest Launch - It had overcome the gap of 1 Lakh, I got everything a first car buyer needed.
And In my case Zest was the first car that I had driven, and I had bought it also. 
Now I had completed 5000 KM driving and I am comfortable to give the performance, milage and experience review.
I had purchased Zest XMS (Petrol) From Shreeji Automart, Surat and they had provided me on time. The guidance Given from the salesmen Mr. Dinesh during test drive was quite impressed me, and I have switched from XM to XMS model.
Exterior Exterior is Amazing, you cant compalin it, Front view, side view looks modern, Almost a complete package from front, Alloy wheels gives some modern looks and I am sure it will not allow me to think for new car in next few years. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space, comfort on zest is outstading, just i was missing Rare AC, but At this price segment I have no complain. Music system by harmen is just outstanding, Speakers are performing beyond expecatations, still I was thinking to add 2 more at boot. Speadometer, Stearing and seats are very comfortable. 3 big People comfortably seat at back seat, and 4 people can also be adjusted for short trip.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I had completed 5000 Km and completed first free services. Enginge is performing well, We can drive easily arround 120 KM SPeed on highway - at average of 16KM/l. When we drive  around 70 to 90 Speed in Eco Mode - average is Coming under 19 When we drive  around 70 to 90 Speed in City Mode - average is Coming under 17.
When we drive  sports mode (Speed above 120) - average is Coming  15 to 16. I have also made a complain of average but when service manager drive my car around 20 KM with AC OFF, My average was coming 22+ on ECO and 19 on Sports mode - We have tracked this on average indicaticators.
Ride Quality & Handling Fantastic car when it comes to handling, Brakes are Nice as I have ABS, Used on first driving and car rematin stable even on placing high speed brackes. Stearing remain stable.
Final Words Not last but, I can say a best car come for me at a right time. Enjoying long drives. And I feel produd owner of the Tata zest.
Staff and Service Manager at Surat Shreeji automart are very supportive. Also I am happy that tata motors itself is checking all the improvements. In last 3 months I had provided almost 7 Feedback to them.
Areas of improvement Door Noise can be improved, Othe things I didnt noticed, As Its my first car it fulfill all my needs.

Full Review 
Exterior
 Pros:
1. Good looks; being a compact sedan, boot has been intergrated properly and look good on overall design.
2. Projector headlamps when litted with fog lamps pulls a fantastic look.
3. Chrome lining outlining the Radiator grill merge with headlights beautifully
4. LED tail lamps looks great along with the fog lamp at the back
 
Cons:
1. DRLs are too bright
2. Tail lamps are LED as advertised however, breaklight remains the conventional bulb lighting
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Pros:
1. Amazing quality; at par with the competition
2. Dual tone interior looks great
3. Best part is the Infotainment system with voice commands; it actualy understands Indian accent easily
4. Ample amount of space at the back even with the front seats all the way back
5. fantastic NVH levels; cabin is so damn quite
 
Cons:
1. Missing armrest; could've been easily integrated, specially in the front seat(s)
2. Mobile charger could've been located near the USB slot to make room for another glass holder which indeed is a requirment in the car
3. Rear seat roof lamp missing; again, important requirement
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Pros: 
1. Engine modes are not gimmick as reported by a few other sites; while Eco does bing down the throttle level; Sports is the mode you'd like to drive in
2. Steering is nice and light; very responsive
3. Gear shifting is smooth
4. Gear suggestion is a welcome move; it actually suggest which gear the car should be on to maximise the FE
 
Cons:
1. I feel there is gear lever vibration; not that it's visible but of you keep your hand on the gear while driving, you could feel the vibration; not sure how is it in other cars in the competetion
2. First three gears needs to be shifted to in quick succession; should've been tuned to hold on the third a little more
3. So far, pretty avg FE figures. Hope it gets better after the first few services
 
Final Words
Best in class Car and a real Value for money. Cheapest in terms of money and best in terms of features among the competetion. Proud that it's made by an Indian Car maker.

Full Review 
So I booked this Decent looking car made by a pathetically cheat company called Tata in the month of October 2014 from Fortune Cars Pvt. Ltd., Wagle Estate, Thane West Mumbai , which is the first car for the family and gift for my parents (I am sure everyone would understand the emotions attached to it unlike this cheat company). I took the delivery of it on 5th December 2014 and from that very moment I was convinced somewhere in my mind that I have made the biggest mistake by buying this car. Let me just summaries the issues in pointers for people to read and if at all some Tata motors official is reading it and is bothered about its customers even a bit.
At the time of delivery itself the car would not start as the battery was down and it had to be jump started to be delivered to me. What an amazing start!!! What a confidence booster!!
All went well till last month when my car met with an unfortunate accident. That’s where the best time with the so called beast starts. I go to Fortune Cars Pvt. Ltd., Wagle Estate, Thane West Mumbai for repairs and that is where I realised that my insurance claim cannot be processed because I still do not have my RC book after over 8 months of registration (Technically it’s the dealerships responsibility to make sure I get it as they even charge for it). So I am made to run around to get some information from the RTO and in the mean while I posted my grievance here on the official Tata Zest Facebook page about the same on 20th July 2015. I was promptly called by the Tata Motors representative and after understanding my problem, they shared the number of Mr. Vinod Gawai (Mobile Number - 9822XXXXXX). I contacted him and explained him with my problem and he assured to get back to me next day morning. But all he did was made someone call from Fortune Cars Pvt. Ltd., Wagle Estate, Thane West Mumbai who just told me that they cannot do anything and I only have to run behind RTO to make sure my insurance claim gets approved. Since that day Mr. Vinod Gawai has "BLOCKED" my number. So I put a post again here on 24 July for the same, and I was not at all surprised that I did not hear anything from Tata Motors. Finally after take leave at work and going through lot of mental harassment and torture I got my car repaired but obviously how can it be perfect when you are dealing with Tata Motors. The Bonnet and the Bumper which were replaced were not fitted properly!!!
The next incident happened on 8th August 2015, when me and my wife decided to have short weekend trip to Mahabaleshwar to relax from routine work life, but looks like Tata Motors does not like its customers having peaceful time. I was on Lonavala ghat where suddenly the wiper stopped working. Somehow I managed to drive till the nearest local garage in heavy rains, where the mechanic told me that the wiper motor has stopped working and needs to be replaced. I mean how an 8 months old brand new car can have such pathetic spare parts!! I somehow managed to drive down till Concorde Motors Pune, near Balewadi Stadium as driving back to Mumbai without wipers was impossible. After checking the problem Concorde motor informed me that the part will need to be changed, to which I agreed. As expected, the part was not available in their workshop, so they checked if it can be made available from any of the Tata Motors authorised workshops in Pune and again as expected I was told that it is not available in entire Pune!!! Calling for the part from company will take at least 3 days’ time and I would have to leave the car in Pune for that much time, so I called Fortune Motors, Thane to check if they can give me any other solution. They checked on their systems if the part is available in Pune, and to my surprise or rather shock, they informed me that it is available at Pandit Auto, Bhosari. I immediately called up Pandit Auto to confirm the availability and left from Concorde ignoring the fact that they had fooled me and cheated me about the availability of spare parts. After reaching Pandit Auto and running behind people there to get work started, Mr. Anil told me that the work cannot happen on the same day as there is no one available to "OPEN JOB CARD IN THE SYSTEM AS EVERY ONE IS BUSY IN DELIVERY (Can I say in cheating new customers)". After fighting with him and pleading him for an hour finally someone agreed to make a Job Card and the inspection started. There came the new problem!! The engine of my car would not turn off even after turning off ignition and removing the key!! Reason behind that was, Concorde motors messed up the wiring while checking for the wiper issue!! After spending nearly 5 hours at workshops for wiper issue finally the car was back to normal and luckily it did not further ruin the already ruined weekend trip!!!!
If you thought I was done, then apologies, but Tata Motors is still not satisfied in spite of torturing so much!!
I gave my car at Fortune Cars Pvt. Ltd., Wagle Estate, and Thane West Mumbai today on 11 August 2015 for second scheduled service. I had an issue with the Bluetooth connectivity that every time after couple of calls, there will be weird disturbance whenever an incoming or outgoing call is made. The service centre personal reported the same to the engineers from Harman, who is the vendor for music system. As I knew they would not agree to the problem till the time they see it for them self, I sent them a video of the problem to which I was told that "iPhone 6 is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THIS SYSTEM!!!!" Are you serious!!! Are you out of your mind!!! One of the most latest and most used and the best phone available in the market is not compatible with your system!!!! Why the hell do you even have this system then!!!! Why the hell do you market it as one of the best feature in the car!

This is my first car.  I'm using this car from October'2014.  I learned driving on this car, and drove 5500+ KM by now.
Exterior Excellent design.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Superior, I can't ask more space than this.  Excellent Infotainment system by Harman.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I like the performance of the engine in long rides, but somehow I feel the pickup is little bit low.  I'm getting around 13 KM/litre mileage in City.  Getting 14-15 in long drives.  Even on bumpy roads, you feel verry comfortable.  Gear box should have been more smoother.
Ride Quality & Handling One word, awesome, you can't expect more than this from a car with this price range
Final Words You shouldn't expect more than what TATA is giving for this price range.  They put a lot of effort for the interiors, and it is worth to have it.  Infotainment system is very very good.
Areas of improvement Gear box should have been more smoother.  They have to improve a lot in after sales service, most of the technicians seems doesn't have the knowledge of this new engine.

Tata has done great things to promote this car in bright light. It has done best work in designing interior and exterior and for driving comfort. By looking at exterior, It is difficult to judge that this is from Tata or from some other expensive brands. Ride & Handling are too class. 200-300 kms in a day can be driven without any discomfort. Seating is very comfortable. Back side seats are very wide and leg room is very large. Infotainment system is stylist in look and best in performance with JBL speaker. It can give you feeling of High end Luxury car. On mileage part too, Tata has done good work..I am getting mileage of 14-15 km/L in city mode in city and 20-22km/L in Eco mode on Highway. In customer service, Tata needs to improve a lot to compete with Honda and Hyundai. I faced some problems in after sales service. Finally they helped me to sort out problems. Other than this, Best car to buy in this budget. Best feature are there compare to Other cars at this cost. Above all, This is a Indian Car.

Exterior Good Design, Swanky Alloy wheels, High luminous light, fog lamps, high ground clearance.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Comfortable, Spacious, Loaded with so many features, adjustable seat & stearing, lots of space inside as well boot space, so many features in odometer & Speedometer.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Performance ok, Average very bad: 8-10 as of now, gear smooth except back gear.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride good but again bad pick up on inclinations, i think one cann't go on hills, it might be risky when there is more than 40 degree inclination,  hand brake not so good again risky.
Final Words Superb car for city drivers  but for touring & excursion on hills seems risky because of very less pick up on inclinations. Suspension is again very good, you might not get jerks on uneven roads & small speed breakers.
Music systems is more of mini home theatre with so many features. Stylish stearing.
Areas of improvement Pick up should be worked on, Fuel economy bad in city( 8-9) as well on Highway.( 10-12). You can mail me before finalization. XXX.XXXXXX@gmail.com

Exterior Awesome exterior,crome linings ,day time running LED gave this car awesome look,projector head lamp,back side brake lamps looks like jaguar. very stable design.looks very nice..some people told here from front zest looks like indica,i want to let them know design is completely different ,if you see itfrom front it looks like laxuary brands.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Comfortable sets, epas sterring gives you perfect drivability, instrument pannel is also nice,dasboard is awsome. If you sit inside it, you can feel like big brand car.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is unbeatable, giving awesome power. Gear ox is also nice. Its not like older tata cars. Fuel economy is comparitively low. But still 15-16 in city with heavy trafic is very nice for me.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality and handling is best in class. Its stearing makes you very confident.
Final Words Its awesome car for every buyer,tata is improving its customer experiance. Its value for money,actually they gave us more than that.
I am driving it since 1 month no problem, Awesome suspension, ac and performance.

 ok.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox.
we bought Zest XM Petrol from Berkley, Chandigarh and were promised mileage of 16.50 km/ltr. However, it is actually coming at 12-12.5 km/ltr. One day car battery stopped working and immediately i had to rush to service statation at Berkley chandigarh. They took 2 hours to investigate that some wire is loose. It got memded but my precious time was lost. 
It has horrible gearbox... it stuck in between and sometimes it come from 3rd to neutral on its own. Due to this my car has to remain in service center for 3 days. They do not have expert technicians at service center and we are left with no other choice than to leave the car at service center as they say technician will come from TATA and they will check. 
Now my car is back from service station but gear consol has been badly re-fixed/fitted, causing gaps. Sometimes, car engine stops when in neutral and sometimes i can hear throbbing sound of engine. However, to my disappointment, service station people could not hear the same.
Ride Quality & Handling
Full of tension. I never expected this from TATA. I thought TATA is in vehicle manufacturing since long and when they had decided about launnching premium sedan, they might have been serious. But, sorry to say i was totally wrong. It is the worst car TATA have made. Horrible. Total waste of money. Heartbreaking.
Final Words
 NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER BUY TATA CARS.

Exterior Exterior does look good projector headlights and led taillights does make it shine. sidelines on body looks sporty, alloy wheel looks nice, sporty character on bonet.  
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior does make you feel special , best interior in all cars of the segment, you will surely love the infotainment system. white illumination and clear instrument cluster view. also a gear shift indicator on cluster. Noise isolation is also very good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performs accordingly well in each of the driving mode, you will surely feel difference in each modes, on a highway trip i got a mileage of 18kmpl on petrol xm variant driving mostly on eco mode and cruising at speed of 100kmph however in city driving on peak traffic hours returns me a mileage of 10-12 however first service of my car isnt done yet so economy may rise afterwards, gear clutch works like charm, in city driving in eco mode would be pain, so mostly try city mode or sports for great pickups. AC and Heater are powerful enough to cool or heat entire cabin in few minutes.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality and handling is good have tested driving on roads with gravel and wet roads cabin insulation is also much better than others cars of the segment. ABS also gives u a confidence in braking.
Final Words You wont get a package like this anywhere else in this price. you wont regret buying it.
Areas of improvement Front side pillars does block view when taking turns it should be taken care off. Rest all glides well for me.

Full Review 
Exterior Looks like a rich primium car of worth more than 9 lakhs.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Are so much smooth and excellent, so that anybody can handel by one fingre.  With Zest, Tata has come a long way ahead when it comes to its interiors. Colour, quality, fit and finish are impressive. – We buy a car to travel comfortably and for that we need SPACE, which is lots in any Tata car and Zest has adequate storage space too for sub 4 meters (390 liters) Getting in and out is fairly easy even for 6 foot+ and seats are comfortable – here Zest blows its competition by large gap.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox are also good. Fule economy in this range.
Ride Quality & Handling Like makkhann"" Smooth and enjoyable. I must say that handling is particularly very good and Zest feels very easy to drive.
Final Words "' It is nice gift to the Indian consumers at that price from Tata Motors.
Areas of improvement Engine cooling should be more effective, so that it may give better comfert.

Exterior Definitely carried forward from the vista but c'mon you've got to look inside a girls heart to know her, outer looks can deceive anybody.!
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) 10/10, there isn't a single thing which isn't there, and everybody out here saying no bottle storage space as such may want to give it a second thought , you can easily chip in a 500ml water bottle, what others might provide is maybe 2 cup holders or bottle storage but hey, do they provide harman music system with a touch screen ??
Choice is yours HARMAN music system or water bottle holders?
Space is excellent, it has always been there in tata cars and this is no exception. Comfort, totally the rugby quoted seats are good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Now fuel economy in city conditions isn't the show stealer for this car, a lot depends on how quickly you shift the gears, up shift or down shift both effect the economy, i've got as high as 13 in economy mode and as low as 8 in the same mode.
Totally depending on my mood and traffic conditions, don't race with this 1.2 tourbocharged and you'll win in this section of economy 
Ride Quality & Handling Amazing, the stearing is super light and feels just the perfect for rough traffic. Won't feel flying at high speeds. 
Final Words I was buying the honda amze at first but then its just too costly for what it offers, airbags with abs are a costly affair with this car and just this even the swift dezire man you've gotta spend about 1.2 lakhs more for the top ends and you won't get the same features namely rear parking sensors and a harman music system with 4 speakers and 4 tweeters, yes with harman you can expect everything.
Its made in india with everything you'd want safety is always sexy if you have it, fair enough to say not everybody has it.
Areas of improvement Add a rear ac vent and provide bottle holders at back too. Front and rear arm-rest can add to the x factor.

Full Review 
Dear Buyer, I change my car every few years (not high end expensive cars) out of my love for cars and doing this since several years. Driven all sorts of cards from Ambassador, Fiat Premier Padmini in 90's to 800, Omni, Cielo, Maruti 1000, Esteem, Gypsy, Sumo, Santro, Ikon, I20, Verna, Zen, Beat and now a Tata Zest. I wasnt much inclined to own a TATA after once having driven a Sumo. I am generally not impressed with the tatamotors brand when this competes with the Hondas, VWs, Chevys and Toyotas. Not much impressed with Suzuki either notwithstanding its ASS network across India.
But this was a turnaround. I test drove Aspire, Dzire, Amaze, Xcent and Zest. For this price, if they give something extra something else would be taken away. Mileage with underpower, Bootspace with passenger space, features or power and if most of the things are there, it is an apt taxi feeling.
Now straight to the point - Tata Zest gives you most and above all - impresses to be a drivers' car. Its a feeling of a Verna Fluidic inside, better than Sunny on a driving experience. The control and weight is amazing. If height and steering is adjusted to your comfort, you feel the control of a high end car.
Exterior Proof that the TATA impression is eating into your impression over the looks. Cover the logo and its comparable to any european car. The front gives the impression of power. The back is Okay but cant help if the designers are forcing themselves into 4 meters. The car looks good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Seats are extremely comfortable. I have a lower back issue and the car bucket seats are awesome. There are some limitations - no space for big bottles, wallet, magazines etc. Features are standard as in other cars and Harman Kardon is good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is powerful. With turbo in petrol is zooms. This car is real power and compare it with 1.6 litre engines. Economy is not like Suzuki for sure. I got a 14 in eco mode in city, 18 in high way. But the engine is still new and its before its first service. Note, I have a full efficient handling type of driving with least braking, maximum roll before speed breakers and signals, gear change is lowest feasible RPM and very soft touch of accelarator. Gear box is good like the Chevys and the Ford.
Ride Quality & Handling Awesome, no doubt. Go the the ghats and you'll realize the piece Tata motors has made. Go 120 KMPH and there is not a bit of shiver. The car is in control. The steering is silky yet commands. Take sharp bends and the car holds them like butter. This is the best part. Perhaps, it was this than anything else which bowls me over. Its a wow in handling to a driver.
Final Words Go for TATA ZEST. I met the ASS and these guys are really improved. They want to make a point. It seems they have used some experience from their European facilities of Jaguar and Rover.
Areas of improvement Dear Tatamotors - Where is the space for my wallet, bottles etc? I need to make it up with accessories. Why not add a handrest for the back seat if not the driver? Eco mode underpowers the vehicle like anything - do you really need this mode? Once you drive in ECO and then in CITY, the latter gives an impression of low mileage, although its not true. Sport is like a takeoff from the road but the mileage bar goes down. Who is racing? CITY is sufficiently powerful. Please ask your dealership to know clear advantages of Zest in the segment. I knew more than them. Ask them to learn by heart the difference in models. Otherwise they were good with service.

Exterior Best exteriors, projector headlamps, clear waistline, broad tyres, and smiling face attracts you.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very spacious, after sitting in zest, you will feel claustraphobic in any Maruti car (except wagon R).
1. Most important feature is the multi mode central console with distance to empty, instant efficiency, two trip indicators
2. Driving modes makes you life easy. I love driving mode. I mainly drive in eco mode. Once you reached the 1700 RPM, TURBO shows its power and you can easly zoom past any one.
3. AC is powerfull. Harman Kardon's music is class apart. Only who has listen to it can understand the quality.
4. Seats are very comfortable. 4 people can accomodate at rear
5. Clutch is light gears get smoother. breaks are good
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
1. Revotron is a very powerfull. I have to switch to eco mode if driving in the city. maximum torque is 140 NM which has a very large range of 1700 to 3000 RPM. It helps in any road, inclined etc.
2. It is a car for long drive. On long distance fuel economy is 19+, city drive can go low to 11 
3. Gear knob is premium.
Ride Quality & Handling Heavy car makes it planted on rad at high speed. Saftey fetaures such as airbags, ABS, CSC, door intrusion beam and iron bars behind the rear seat makes it a tough vehicle. Steering is butter smooth thanks to ePas, CSC helps in high speed turns
Final Words I wanted a strong and sturdy car within budget, My friend who is a Territory Sales manager (with Mahindra) recommended me this vehicle and I am thonkfull to him
He told me one thing to check the strength of the vehicle open the bonnet of the car and hold it in your hand. I did it. Zest's bonnet was 2 times heavier than Dzire, Xcent, Grand i10.
Areas of improvement Nothing.

Exterior Excellent,look beautitull. Indian. looks very attractive. my is sky grey.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Well addressed. safety is one of the reasons to go for it and feels good. could have improved a little bit..(bottle hoalder). i am 6 feet tall and get a good leg room at rear sit.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Petrol- nice pick up, tend too feel turbo lag at low RPM but the moment it rises you feel it very responsive. nice feel to drive. fuel economy started with 8.. now on eco mode is 12-14 in city and highways 14-15 max at times touch low to 11. but still expect to rise. done with fist servicing. eco is bit sluggish but it ok not much of a concern for me. sports mode will make you go wroommm.
Ride Quality & Handling Good, very light and responsive. it feel in control. 
Final Words Over all nice car and loving it.. will keep it for long!!!
Areas of improvement Fuel economy is to be looked on and bottle holder a must.

Dear Friends - Good Day!!
Coming from a middle class family, the first thing comes to anybody's mind is "Value for Money". Zest is the answer for your quest for VFM.
I along with my friends went for test driving all the cars. Three of my friends are hardcore Maruti fans and have Swift, Ritz and Zen. The response from all on driving Zest is WOW. Having learned to drive car recently, even I was amazed with the response of Zest while test driving.
Let’s be realistic, who cares for your car more than you. So please check what you get for the hard earned money you spend on a car which is taken on loan.
For less than 5.5 Lakhs [excluding the registration, insurance, etc] in Chennai, I got all 4 power windows, harmen music system, steering wheel mounted music and phone control, projector head lamps, fully electronic ORVM,ABS, Alloy wheels. Check the price of any hatchback with these features in other brands, it will be more than 6.5 lakhs. I got a sedan with great boot space.
The interior space is amazing. For one short trip to beach, 6 adults and 3 kids travelled in my car. 4 adult can sit in the rear seat if they are lean. The seats are broad and comfortable. As usual in all TATA cars, legroom was never an issue in both front and back. For long trips, with all the luggage packed in the boot, it is only people in the car which is a great relief when you have elders who travel in the car.
On the exterior, TATA did a genuine work to bring a new classic look which is new to this segment. The projector head lamps looks sharp but not mean. My car is sky grey and has the executive look and you feel important when people turn their heads to get a second glance on the new model.
The dashboard covers all aspect of the car, for new drivers like me, the gear indicator is a boon, at the right speed, we are reminded to change gear. Since the car was easy to drive, I dared to drive to Bangalore along the Hosur route since it is mostly 4 way lane. I did not realize that I have touched 130kmph until I checked the speedometer. The car sailed so smoothly.
Honestly I was getting only 9 or 10 in the city and I got 13kmpl for the Bangalore trip and I was bit disappointed with the mileage. But friends assured me that car mileage will improve beyond 5000 km. But I could see difference after first service which I gave after driving 1700 Km. The big change in mileage came after crossing 4000 km. I went on a long trip down south up to Rameshwaram. Zest really swallows pot holes. The high ground clearance really helped in certain parts were the highway was under construction near puthukkothai district. Now city mileage is around 12km [promised 13km] and highway is around 17km [promised 17km] with AC always on.
Another amazing feature is the various modes of drive. Zest becomes three different cars in each mode. Eco mode – It becomes small car like alto wherein it will take quite some time to pick up. City mode is standard sedan style drive. The sports mode made me jump up in joy. Power is so visible and you feel that you are in a race car [I know it is exaggeratedJ]. What I am trying to say is that car brings more power and you can over take all those messy truck and bus drivers with ease in sports mode. Warning – do not use sport mode continuously then we you return to city mode, you may not like it.
To summarize, I am not getting paid to promote ZEST so I am not claiming it is THE BEST. But for the money invested, I got a wonderful package and this car brings smiles on my family face whenever we travel and is pocket friendly for me so what more you could ask for.
ZEST up your life.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
If you DEZIRE to buy a new car or upgrade, take a look at ZEST, you will be AMAZEd at the features. Test drive will make you dELITEd (delighted).
Switching ECO to SPORT mode can overtake the likes of ecosport at AMAZEing speed, DUSTing off the Tall boys on the highway.
Ride Quality & Handling
Very smooth drive, with E-power steering for better control at high speeds.
Stable even at 170kms/hr speed.
In ECO mode on highways, I get 18kms/litre milege (at 100-110kms/hr speed). Good road grip even in wet conditions.
Switching modes is very easy and you see the effect in a minute, in terms of power, speed and proportionate change in milege.
 
Final Words
 Thumbs UP to the fantastic effort by TATAs.
Clocked 15,380 kms in 10 months and no complaints, except for milege and radiator noise on stopping.
TATA service has improved to a great extent. 
Areas of improvement  
 Radiator continues to run even after switching off the engine draining your battery and also creates an embarrassment in public.
Rear shocks and even rear doors are hard.
Second gear power pickup is too low.

Exterior
 Exterior looks awesome, projector headlamps are really good and helpful for night drive.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Interior gives a rich feel. The whole ambience is very comfortable. Lot of feature are available at your disposal and useful too. Ample of space for 3 in rear, so much so 4 thin creature can also fit in. Ride quality is very comfortable. Because of bigger wheels, bad roads are not of much concern.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine is responsive. With petrol I am withdrawing 15kmpl, but without A/C in use. Gear shifts are smooth, almost effortless.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Very impressive. Need not worry too much about bad roads, fun to drive.
Final Words
 I am thoroughly impressed with the car. The money I have paid, is worth spending. I am enjoying the ride everyday.
Areas of improvement  
 Only that Tata Motors needs to improve on Customer Care and dealing with them. I got the car after 33 days of my booking the car, though I was promised 3 weeks.

Full Review 
Exterior Good. I like the design and style. Its preety better as compare to other Sedan in this segmant. I like the overall design, the fabric of seat etc.
Note: Met cover, seat cover and other accessories wouldnt be provided by Tata so, do purchase it.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good, I like the harmon speaker, space and seat are very comfortable. Harmon infomaint is x-factor and it feels great that you have all control on steering.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Poor. I would say worst. Today, I just run for 1 hr and gas started to corome from bumper and then I called tata motor for assitance. They shared me complaint-id and when I called back after 40 mns they ask me to complain again. Their support reach very late and then they just open bumper and said it happen as you ride on hand brake. I am very disaapointed with their response.
Ride Quality & Handling I dont know the Reason behind sport as when you switch the mode there is only marignal difference. city mode is normal which all car segmant has and in eco your engine create some noise which I DONT LIKE!!!
Final Words Wont recommend to purchase it. My personal expereince.
Areas of improvement Engine and service. The support staff is very bad.

I have booked the car around 3rd September, when the Delivery Comitment was 4 to 5 weeks, it is 16th October today still the vehicle is in transit and not sure when they will Deliver it, shows the failure in delivery system.
I had Put a complaint mail on TATA ZEST mail ID still None from Tata Motors has contacted me to understand the kind of problem I am facing.
On daily basis Customer only has to Folllow up with delership to know the status of the Car. for which they had a typical answer that Car is alloted by TATA Motors, the 
Even though Tata has Created a Masterpiece Like Tata Zest with Low Pricing and Good Looks it is the Delers and some of the Regional or terretory managers worst response time and commitments giving worst experince to Customers.
Till the Tata motor not work on that they will achieve their old Glories.

Overall the looks in this category is best in Zest.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) I test drive the zest 2 days before, Back Door Hard to open, Mid Range Power is less, Back Seat design had some problem, It is getting back pain while sitting.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good, Feel some lack of power while over taking.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality & Handling are Excellent
Final Words Overall Excellent car,This much features u will never get in any car with this price, Audio system awsom! Tata Should rethink about atleast about back door and seat
Areas of improvement Mid range power, Back seat is not comfortable, Back Door is too hard to open.

I booked Tata Zest XT (Petrol) Model on 30th Oct 2014, At the time of booking sales man gives me guaranty that he will give me the Car on or before 5th Dec 2014. So I go ahead and booked the car without any delay.
And now after 15 days when i call him regarding the status he told me that there is delay in delivery. So its not possible to deliver the Car on 5th Dec 2014, it will take another 15-20 days to deliver the car. I don't understand if they were not able to give the car on committed date why they have committed that they will give the car on the date.
I also logged a complaint regarding this with Tata Motors customer care, they told me that they will call me within 48 hrs. I logged the complaint on 15th Nov 2.41 PM,Its more then 48hrs now I am still waiting for reply no reply from tata motors. Its totally wast of time to take a follow-up of your complaint because i think they don't care about customer problems .Whats the use of customer care if they are not able to solve the customer problems.

Exterior Excellent-best in classs. Has a solid look, especially the rear, only if u look sideways near the front door.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very good.though one bottle holder could have altered perceptions.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox : Lacks rev slow pick up.. even unsure if it will climb steep mountains... :) .. Initial start - Engine sounds like Diesel but once on the move very very smooth..ultimate...I can vouch this as  I drive it nearly for a month and a half now.
Ride Quality & Handling You would enjoy.
Final Words A good buy .But you would have to compromise on 'pick-up' . At higher RPM's its really good. Otherwise a good value for money car. Anyway u get at a cheaper price compared to other entry sedans.Hence the bad mileage 'fadens out' when you look arithmetically.Even other sedan cars have issues and this vehicle looks solid.
Areas of improvement None.

Exterior
 Would probably be the best exterior among its rivals. It is really a masculine car with tough body, good height and nicely designed cuts and curves. Seeing it, you will definitely feel it like a perfectly shaped man. Beautiful LED tail light, that you will find only in luxury cars. Alloy wheels add cherry to the icecream.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
This is where the car stood far ahead of its rivals. Fully loaded with features. Starting with the excellent infotainment system powered by Harman. Very nice sound quality with 4 tweeters and 4 speakers. Bluetooth music and phone connectivity support that will definitely help you in receiving your calls while driving cars. Audio and phone controls on steering makes your drive an ease. Steering is light and small. Believe me you will feel very easy while taking sharp turns. Cabin space is very good. Plastics quality is premium with dual tone. Boot space is enough for your weekends.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Zest is powered by 1200 cc engine that give 90 bhp power. You will love to drive the car. Especially the multidrive feature is really you feel when you change the driving mode. Kudos to the zest team for great innovation. Not pretty sure with the economy. I have recently purchased the car and currently it is giving 8Km/l.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is superb. You will not feel tired even after driving fro 3-4 continuous hours. Sterring handling is superb. Everything you need is appropriately placed in the car.
Final Words
 Definitely a car that will bring Tata back in the race. A must buy car if you are looking for a 'value for money' car.
Areas of improvement  
 Should provide rear defogger in XMS model.

Exterior The  car is feature loaded, with high performance and superb looks.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) I found that there was rear was very spacious, good in cabin noise isolation, Excellent music system.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Best in class. I compared it with swift desire and excent. Iniially I was hesitating and planning to take polo since both are priced at the same range. After I took a test drive of this and the new VW polo, I removed VW polo from my list (main cause was the rear seat comfort).
Ride Quality & Handling Clutch is very light, Again this was compared to polo. you get a sense of stability while driving in high speeds. No body roll at all. Could not test the corner stability  as there was no proper roads in chennai to test it.
Final Words Simply the best. Hatsof to TATA. I made my booking soon after my test drive was done. i never took time to change my decision. According to me this car was the best car in the segment.(Compring it with  Swift Dzire, Chevorelete Sail , Hyundai Xcent, Vw Polo, Hyundai i20 elite, Maruthi Swift).
People have a wrong openion about the TATA cars for their make, customer service, After sales service. I believe that tata has taken a huge leap to make a great come back to the market.
Final Words.: Have a test drive to beileve it. Its no longer old tata car.Its a new game changer for TATA.
Areas of improvement Rear defigger was provided ony in top end variant. hope they make it standard in all varitants like how ABS is standard in all models ( except the initial base variant).

 Good finish and good quality materials used in the cabin bulit, nice insulated cabin which makes hard to guess to such a level that it is difficult to tell if the engine is in on or off mode(petrol), 3 can sit on the rear without any issue at all and good leg room no problem on long journeys at all, the air bags are included only for 7 lakhs on road for both driver seat  and copassenger makes it a safe car, in bulit security alarm is cool and secure, 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox

 Brilliant Ride quality and handling

 Though Earlier products were not as refined but were still pretty useful and practical Im yet to exeprience the Service which was pain point previously

I bought Tata Zest XMS petrol in January 2015. It has been run 7200 kms. Drinking petrol like monster. No pickup, even Maruti 800 crosses my car after traffic lights. AC is worst. Noices in cabin. Worst car I have ever drive.
Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good Space & seat height.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Vibration and noice in engine, Fuel average of 11.5 km/l. Shaking gearbox.
Ride Quality & Handling Ok.
Final Words Please do not buy at all. If thinking please go through Dezire or Amaze.
Areas of improvement All car need to be improved and specially engine, AC and interior material. Engine makes lots of vibration and performance is pathetic. Tata has failed to make a car which can break it previous image of underquality products. Even 90 BHP of this petrol car doesnt match with my other 75 BHP diesel car.In peak Summers I cant stop my sweat running, AC sometimes stop working and only fan work.

I have purchased new zest petrol XT in  February 2015.
Exterior is very good looking.
Interior is confortable & spacious.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy is good, and Gearbox working good with full clutch press.
Ride Quality & Handling is good, Harman music system fitted is impressive. good boot space for weekend. 
Rubber seal & Plastic parts fitted on windscreen front side is unmached there is visible gape, which could be improved. Mud is entering into engine compartment. Insufficient Space for holding bottel which is need to improve.
Poor responce after sales, I had to contact every time for menual book, bill & invoice, Extended warrenty booklet & covering document, Annual maintenance booklet (which is still not provided) & vehicle registration card. All the above documents & necessory informations should be provided by authority with responsibility.
Poor resale value if you go for exchange tata car. Careless & poor sales. Yet I don't know about the servicing department.
Don't go on fancy features. Decide carefully before purchase.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox VERY VERY BAD. Poor Mileage - ONLY 8.00 Kms/l. Pick up is very bad. Pulling and speek is very very bad.
Ride Quality & Handling Good. But when you brake, you feel the drum hitting your leg.
Final Words I do not receommend any one to buy this car. Tata has to really work on this car. The gear box is very very bad. Some times gears do not work at all. Many times in important junstions I could not get in to reverse gear at all. The gear rod feels wiiered.
Areas of improvement Gear box, engine, power, mileage, pulling and speed. After sales service. The customer relationship is very bad. After you buy the car no one cares for you. The exterior paining is very poor. The paint just goes away.

Exterior The Best looking Compact Sedan, VFM. Also the car comes with Body Kit from OEM Tata and looks awesome.
Boot Opener Could have been given in the Remote Key or atleast button shold have been given. Boot lid has to been opened from key only 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good Interiors with loaded features like Steering mounted Audio Controls, Multi Infotainment System with BT connectivity, USB, AUX, Electronic OVRM
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Decent Engine but at times there is a lag in Second gear at low RPMs.
Fuel Economy:
City: 14 - 15 kmpl
Highway: 18 with AC
Comes with ABS + EBD and CSC(Corner Stability Control) from second variant. Multi drive mode is the best. You can actually feel the response in Sport Mode. Eco is purely fr Mileage with very low pickup. City is the Mix both.
Ride Quality & Handling Decent Ride Quality, Shocks are a little stiff, Handling is swift and clean. 
Final Words The Best compact Sedan with fully loaded features for the best price available in market.
Areas of improvement Rear AC needs to be added. The compartments in the door needs to be wider to atleast fit a 1Litre bottle. Boot Lid to be opended from outside like any other door without Key when unlocked.

Full Review 
Went on a long drive to Goa recently  with me Zest XMS petrol..thot i'd share some reviews...
Exterior Brilliant looks, just LOVE the Projector lamps..life saving..good looks even from the back..has a good ground clearance compared to other vehicles in the segment.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Soft-huge seats, very spaciuos at the back..powerfull AC.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Powerfull engine..especially the TURBO..gearbox was slightly noisey initially but is getting smoother with more usage..fuel economy is decent for city at around 13-16.
Ride Quality & Handling Good handling especially at tight corners, and also at high speeds. braking is good..just love the clutch..those that have driven the old Indica will know what I mean!!
Final Words Initially had a Indica XETA (Petrol) so the ZEST is definetly a much more refined and advanced car when compared.
Areas of improvement Will have to wait n watch with respect to the servicing provided by Tata. The first servicing was just a quick top up of all the liquids and cleaning of the car.

BY THE DEALER CONCORD AVERAGE WAS FOUND 13.6 KM/LT ALSO PRACTICAL, AVERAGE DURING EVERY DAY RUN IN LAST 3000 KM IN CITY HIGHWAY REGULAR, RUN AVERAGE IS FOUND TO BE 8.5 KM/LT IN CITY MODE.
ON COMPLAINT TATA'S REPLIED THAT THIS IS NORMAL & CAR IS OK. THEY ALSO ADVICE THAT EVEN ON HIGHWAY YOU SHOULD DRIVE AT 60 KM/HR. WHEN EVERYBODY INCLUDING RIKSHAW OVERTAKES YOU & ONLY YOU CAN OVERTAKE.
CYCLE / BULLOCK CAR. ON COMPLAINING TO ARAI THEY CONFIRM THAT AVERAGE TEST TAKEN ONLY IN LAB.
ON SPECIFIC SAMPLE CAR GIVEN BY COMPANY. THEY DO NOT SELECT RANDOM SAMPLE. FROM THE CARS IN DEALER STOCK. THEY DO NOT TAKE PRACTICAL LONG DRIVE TRIAL. IN CITY AS WELL AS HIGHWAY.
Ride Quality & Handling OK.

Exterior
The vehicle styling and dmiensions give the feel of SUV. You can easily identify your vehicle in the parking lot. It gives a bluffy look with the front grill and back style
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
THe ineterior compare to other brands is really catchy. Adjustable seat gives you a comfort of long drive without getting tired
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Running smooth, completed one year, only shifting in 2nd gear is bit uncomfortable
Dont see much effect between the CITY and ECO mode but the booster works for torque
 
Ride Quality & Handling
A very comfortable for long rides. I have driven almost for 12~16 hrs continuos. Its fun to drive with best quality harman music system
 
Final Words
 
Areas of improvement  
TATA really needs to work to have better service network/staff & infrastructure at dealers. Dealers like Miles Motors the only dealer they are least bothered about the service.

Full Review 
I have been driving Tata Zest XM model from june 2015. I bought ZEST from
Most of the reviews are fake here. Even some impressed me before I could decide to buy.
Firstly, I waited to for first free service  and then waited for 5000 kms to complete for getting exact Mileage. THis is what I am dying for these days. See, you think less cost and buy this ZEST then petrol cost, you would paid in next 2-3 years can impact your pocket. I don't know about diesel variant. 
Look and Style: Very modern look and style.
Comfort: Very comfortable and made for Indian roads.
Pickup: Can beat even BMW.
Mileage: Like Trucks, 8.6 to 8.9 litre/KM in city drive specially in Bangalore traffic for Petrol version. I don't go or drive on Highway everyday. I drive for office everyday.
Best Features: Multi Drive, its really cool feature.
Needs to improve: Mileage.
Overall Experience: If you don't talk about Mileage then best car to drive on Indian roads and a great suspension for rough roads. AC power is also good.
I drive my tata zest xm petrol from jhansi to delhi without taking rest and i got overall performance is good but i got only 12km/l fuel econmy so if anyone can efford 9km/l in city and 12km/l on highway than can buy otherwise diesel versions are batter than petrol
I want to say to tata motors that they have to do something else for fuel economy otherwise as usually tata to tata hi hai.

Exterior
 Excellent look and design, looks more stylish. Stands out when comparing with swift Dzire, Amage, Baleno etc.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Comfortable and spacious car in the segment. Harman Infotainment made everything easy on their integrated voice command for Music, AC, FM, Calling etc. A good DJ like sound quality with 8 speakers. AC is good, Tilt steering n adjustable seat has made it more comfortable, even u can comfortably sleep when tired from long drive.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Powerful Engine, Easily picksup from 2nd gear with AC on when car is fully stopped. Tata claims 17KM/Ltr. I have driven car more than 3000Kms and getting Average on Highway n city (both inclusive) 15.6 KM/Ltr. Just had my first service and is getting more smooth. Gearbox is like a finger touch. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Nice in night as adjustable projector lamps, Reverse parking assistance made it more convienent for parking. 
Final Words
Excellent car from tata, Value for money. one can find better solutions like the features provided by TATA but have to pay almost double, e.g. Maruti Ciaz top model is comparable with this TATA Zest XT but for that one has to pay almost 1.5 times.    
Areas of improvement  
 Tata should launch Petrol version in AMT as well

Full Review 
Exterior : Looks are really deceptive, at first the car looks clean and niche', however as usual the devil is in details, too much ill fitment of  panels and bonnet cap
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) : Very spacious at the backseat, comfortably accomodates 3 at rear, the music system is appealing and nice specially on long trips, however the buzzing noice from the dashboard indicates loose fitment and takes away the comfortable silence of the ride
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: The ECO mode can be used on highways where no thurst or boost is necessarily required (if you are not a speed enthusiast) otherwise it's of no use in city traffic. SPORT mode is a real fun to drive which makes the ride peppy and the car becomes really really responsive to throttle. Gearbox is above average and the gear shift is smooth. Fuel economy ranges between 12-17 kmpl based on traffic conditions, mine after 3200 kms shows average fuel economy of 14 kmpl
 
Ride Quality & Handling : Nice suspension, amazingly comfortable for driver and passengers. I hope TATA work on decreasing the blindspots of pillar and RVM on driver side. The placement takes complete view of anyone coming from 2o'clock
 
Final Words : I would categorize the final words in 1) Cars to Drive - This one is a real delight for driving, comfort, sound system quality etc. 2) Cars to Buy - Well I would say a big "NO", nitty gritties in the vehicle are so much in number in terms of engineering and fitments that you will come across one after other each day. To name few of them a) The bonnet fitment is having different size gaps on either sides, the dashboard fitment is having more than 1 cm gap on driver side and less than 3 mm on the other, on rough roads the dashboard's buzzing noise gives you a feel of 5 years old car, the BT system of car hangs every second day and doesn't responds to phone calls. So it's not a car to own but surely 2-3 drives are worth to know that TATA atleast tried.
 
Areas of improvement : Engineering of panels, dashboard fitment, loose plastics

Exterior
 The exterior of the vechicle is very decent and if you let Dzire, Amaze, Xcent stand in a row than you will let the know the difference. In front of ZEST all other sedans looks very small. You will get good view of road, since the height of the seat and ground clearance is best in the segment.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 No doubt the interior is very cool, the Harman music system is so cool, like you got handsfree calling, all music controls on steering etc.  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Loaded with Revetron engine and you can drive the ZEST in three modes as per your requirement. You can change the gears with fingers so smooth. Never need to press accelerator, brake so soft.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is like some luxurious car. If you let someone with cloths on eye and let him sit he will feel lile sitting in Mercedes or audi.
Final Words
 No doubt best Car to go far.

Full Review 
Exterior Brilliant Exterior Design except the front looks similar to Tata Vista hence the whole appeal of freshness vanishes in second. The 'humanity line' should go away to give a fresh start to TATA. Nobody wants to own a TAXI INDICA, & similarity with INDICA is one big thing which is pulling the sales down.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Awesome, very nice, comfortable, you can drive for 100 kms without having back ache. Controls are well placed & practical.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox It's not car to be driven; it's for chauffer driven. Poor fuel economy, gearbox is good. But since my previous car was Alto, I miss the gearbox & pick up of Alto.
Ride Quality & Handling Very good
Final Words Need improvement; shed the indica look & humanity line- success will be yours
Areas of improvement Fuel Economy, Engine Power, Storage Space in cabins. There is NO BOTTLE HOLDER.

 Looks like Volks Wagen if u hide Tata Logo, Nice comfort, 4 person can accomadate in rear seat, nice driving experience, but poor millage..also i have facing some problem in AC...AC is not chilling fast in 35degree... they have taken my car for 5 days to solve this problem but it's a pure waste...Tata have to appoint good engineers in their work shop to solve the problem.. the current people don't know how AC works in this car... they fail to explain how AC works in Auto Mode...
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Fuel economy very bad..in city ony 7-8 KMPL in bumper to bumper traffic, highway around 14.5 KMPL.. I have driven around 9000 KM this car..good comfort but u have to sacrifice millage..
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality amazing.. good steering.. u can touch 140 KM without any hesitation in Highway.. but again u have to compromise with millage...Servicing this car is easy if you know any body in Service centre other wise nightmare !!
Final Words
Good Car with poor millage...Tata have to work on millage and AC.. Also they have to appoint good service engineers in the work shop..otherwise no point in releasing in NEW Cars...This will become TATA-Try again Try again..!!!!!!!
Areas of improvement  
Improvement in Service centre...Provide knowledge to the service person & do something for improvemnet in millage & AC...

Exterior Excellent fit and finish, modern looks.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Basic XE model is VFM except audio system, spacious, comfortable for five adult people. Excellent ride quality, but years will tell the truth.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox New petrol engine is fun to drive, Very sensitive turbo, so needs lot of care n attention. Overweight car for a petrol engine, resulting in less mileage, Gearbox is usual for a Tata product.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent, but braking needs lot of attention for a basic version without ABS...
Once the turbo open in Eco mode itself,  it's not easy to stop the vehicle suddenly. Thinking of sports mode??? So Abs compulsory, but need to drive carefullt
Steering is light to drive.
Final Words Good car but bad brand image. Took a month for delivery of a basic model, because everyone opt for higher versions.
Areas of improvement Please reduce weight of the car atleast for petrol version. After sales Service, Warm and friendly customer service needed. For every queries, they don't answers, but have an excuse.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox All good till now (purchased 1 week before only so will take time to judge on this).
Ride Quality & Handling Seems to be excellent. Suspension is quite good. No jerks at all.
Final Words Superior product from TATA. Go for the same if looking for sedan segment. Also want to mention that got nice customer experience while dealing with Concorde Motors, Baner, Pune. Will recommend this name if you want to go for TATA vehicle.

Its superb car for drive and very comfortable, I booked on launch itself lcopmaring with amaze desire and xcent  was my right choice buying this car instead of Desire, amaze and xcent, it can easily beat market leading cars in few aspects. Good exterior look n elegant lights.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) GREAT CABIN SPACE ,GOOD LOOKING INTERIORS WITH MUSIC SYSTEM AND REAR PARKING SENSORS.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox HAVE DONE 4000 KILOMETRS CITY AND LONG RIDES AND AVERAGE MILEAGE SHOWS 11KM/LITRE  BUT LONG DISTEANCE WORKS OUT TO BE 15KM/LIT AT AVG SPEED 70 KM/HOUR GOOD ENGINE AND GEAR BOX GEAR SHIFTING IS EXCELLENT.
Ride Quality & Handling VERY GOOD FOR LONG DRIVING AND EASY FOR HANDLING.
Final Words VALUE FOR MONEY INDIAN CAR.
Areas of improvements City mileage to be looked in probably at the 3rd service at the year completion they may tune up engine probably should give fuel efficiency in city as promised.

Exterior
 Stylish body with good lighting system. Good ground clearance. But workmanship shoddy. Bonnet lock plastic cover gave way, wiper spray pad on the bonnet not stuck properly. Tata Motors have agreed to replace. Side rearview mirrors could have been the folding type.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)  
Comfortable Interior with good A/C and leg space. Seats front and back comfortable for five adults. Good infotainment system. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Powerful engine though the torque conversion for the first gear is bit too much. Car moves at 10/15 kph without any acceleration. But engine is noisy. The engine used to stall often initially which was rectified but still even now occasionally the engine raises uncomfortably even with very slight acceleration which takes you by surprise. I get only 9.5/10.5 km/l in city drive even after the dealer and Tata Motors tried their best. Very disappointing when they advertise 17.2  Km/l. Shifting to reverse gear is a problem quite often and shifting to other gears is also noisy.
Ride Quality & Handling
Car gives a comfortable ride quality and driving comfort is also good. But occasionally while taking U turn, I find that the steering does not return automatically.
Final Words
The car has fallen short of my expectation as I was happily using a Honda City for 8 years and went for the Tata Zest after reading the reviews and the supposed to be advanced features developed by Tatas. 
Areas of improvement  
 Workmanship has to improve. And the Engine has to be absolutely silent especially in idling.

Exterior Looks are not bad. The tail lamp goes really with the rear design. Front could have looked sharper. Orvms's don't fold though.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Best in class interiors. Cabin noise is minimum and mostly unnoticeable. Back support and under thigh support is optimal. A/C with climate control plus great audio system makes for a pleasurable experience.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance is good. Fuel economy can be improved. My instrument display reads 9.1 kmpl. Gear box though smooth still feels a little clunky. The car feels slightly underpowered. Though this is made up for in the sports mode.  
Ride Quality & Handling This is the best aspect of the car. Ride quality and handling is unmatched. Goes over bumps and potholes smoothly.
Final Words The car is a massive upgrade from it's predecessor. A few things like gear stick and hand brake feel a bit inferior. My experience with the car so far has been good. After sales service has been quick and hassle free. I would suggest this car to anyone looking for a compact sedan.
Areas of improvement Fuel economy can be improved, orvm's don't fold, front design can be better.

Areas of improvement It is cover good area. Other Exterior ITS VERY NICE, REAR PARKING SENSOR AND SIDE MIRROR INDICATORS, BUT HEAD LIGHT WE AS A CUSTOMER DONT PREFER AND LIKE THAT GETTING BIGGER SIZE. OTHERWISE AS USUAL ITS.
Exterior New aggressive looks. Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Nice and usefull interior, designed with common sense, Stock Audio system is off the hook! Engine.
It is a very failmy car for space and toher facility. So it is very cost  consuming car other then just Honda Amaze, Verena, E20. Etc
it is very populr car in today and most wanted car in a small familiy.
It is good like other then car. it is very good sporty loock.
Look and Style: Looks from front like Swift. From Side it looks like Sedan.

Best Features: Bold looks, Good A/c & Dual color interiors. Needs to improve: On Exterior Aerodynamic design.

Latest updates missing as u get in a hyundai car, space less as compared to a Honda car


Full Review 
The ride quality is good, ride is comfortable. But the problem I am facing is I get a mileage of 15-16 (full tank to tank). Whereas the fuel meter in the car is showing an average of 21-27!!!
When I brought this to the notice of the service centre people, they told me the meter was ok. One of them even told me that the mileage is calculated only when the car runs at a speed of 20 km/hr and higher. I was amazed at this because that doesnot represent a true picture of mileage at a bumper to bumper traffic. Now is my meter wrongly calibrated? Or is maruti presenting a positive biasness to the users?
Experienced people please help!!!
Final Words Car is good. Please improve on the faulty meter reading part and remove the positive biasness on mileage front.
Areas of improvement NA.

Got my swift dzire vxi yesterday (14 June) and have driven 460 kms already.. so iam writing this review.
Exterior Exterior of the car is awesome the car looks big and attractive from front and rear.. tho from the side the boot doesnt look so good.. overall very nice looks
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Dual tone interior looks very good.. space in rear seat is good..many people said it has less rear seat space but its not true.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine sounds really smooth while idling, and while driving aswell, engine gets really hot when driving around 100-120 for an hour or so.
Ride Quality & Handling Handling is very good .. car corners at 100 kmph very easily, but consider changing 165mm tyres, I got MRF ZV2k on my car.. the tyre noise is high above 100 km/h.
Final Words If u love speed you should buy swift dzire petrol which is best car under 7 lakh. Unlike amaze which is restricted to 140 km/h. But id recommend getting ZXI which has airbags & abs for safety. If you drive above 120 kmh.
Areas of improvement 185mm tyres on VXI/VDi atleast if not alloys, better sheet metal, foldable rear seat, height adjustabel seat for VXI, ABS for Vxi.

Ride Quality & Handling Highly Elevated level of satisfactory as it has more sleeky & cheeky factors.
Final Words INCH-PERFECT car for every Family to access.
Areas of improvement Car has Zero error which clicks me to STEER my GEARS of LIFE. Assign well-trained professionals and personnels in service unit as they are inept to configure.

Exterior Having awesome looking from side, front & back view. Best styling in this price range.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Overall good in this price range of car. Having all types of feature for normally rewuired by every person.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox providing 17.5 KM/L with AC on in case of when an learner is driving it. Expert can take around 20 KM/L very easily. I think Amaze , Xcent & Tata Zest not providing this fuel economy.
Ride Quality & Handling Village road are always bad, this car is designed for villagers where road are not good. On good road nano also provide good performance but in case of bad roads there is need really good car. So it is best in this price.
Final Wordsbuy it if you want sedan car in this price range. Best car for middle class family.
Areas of improvement Changes are always required in every area after some time. Its nature truth.

Exterior
 Not bad. Many people complian about the shape of bootlid but if we compare with Xcent and Amaze overall-Dzire is a winner over other all factors.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 I have a VXi. It includes all features that are available with competitors in similar versions except Bluetooth & ABS, I feel that it can be added in VXI.Space is good for a family of 5 big fat people :). Driving comfort is good in city/highway. Only on Hills, Toyota wins the race in this segment. Dzire and Xcent almost the same on hills..Honda Amaze slightly better than Dzire and way better than Xcent. Interior material quality is reach, In its segment, interiors are premium class.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine performs well overall except on hills you feel sad that you are driving Dzire!
Fuel Economy is satisfying at 17kmpl on highway (With AC). Without AC it has given me 19+ as well at times. In city, you will be pleased to get the average of minimum 13,depends on the driving style.
Gearbox is smooth(Dzire 2015 model)
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride quality is good overall. Engine needs more torque, Handling is good. 
Final Words
 Nice family sedan car,Value for money and well its a time tested vehicle so FAITH is there
Areas of improvement  
 Maruti can add little more feature like Bluetooth,ABS in its Middle variants of petrol to compete      easily with Amaze,Xcent and Etios. Engine performance on Hills is an issue to be fixed on priority

Exterior -I liked new headlamps and fog lights are changed with added chrome and the wheels are so good Now. Bored from old dzire look this new version of sedan rocked
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)-Interiors are good .. space is quite sufficient and 5 can easily fit here. And boot space is so large. Coming to the comfort .. Seats can get better width
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox-The thing which wow ed was the Mileage... 21 in the city was great and gearbox is quick and soft and engine's power is less which should not be any concern if we are getting amazing Mileage.
 
Ride Quality & Handling- Good handling, good interiors, comfortable, good fuel economy       
 
Final Words -BEFORE BYING CONFIRME TAKE NOTE FROM SPARE WHEEL SHOULD BE ALOYE WHEEL/Reverse Gear Problem in Every Maruti Cars

Exterior
 Looks are good, high stance, love the chrome front and rear grills, the retractable OVRM's. For me it looks better than the Amaze or the Xcent.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Good features for the price like the Push start, auto AC, dual tone interiors, good music system, the fit and finish are also very good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Petrol engine is very silent and good but a little out of of breath in the hill driving. Fuel economy is great for a sedan car. Gear box is precise.
Ride Quality & Handling
 The handling is perfect even while cornering in hills at speed. Braking is also excellent. Ride quality is good. Handles the bumps effectively.
Final Words
Value for the money.
Areas of improvement  
Make the engine a bit torquier as it looses breath in the hill. Add some more features like the navigation system, leather upholstry, rear camera, etc in the high end models.

Full Review 
ExteriorEtios G White. Dont forget to negotiate before paying the booking amount. You can always get all the regular accessories free. I purchased from New Delhi. So, got sun wisors, mats , read door garnish, trunk mat, mud flaps free. Exterior wise, this car is basically classy and robust and not stylish like Amaze or Dezire. But it give an executive look and kind a mature statement rather than teen-hormone driven statement. So i think its for people who want to buy a car for family comfort, status symbol within this price bracket, reliable car and want a car for atleast 8 to 10 yrs.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Space and comfort are real assets of this car. You wont believe the boot space and driving comfort. Take this on long drive and you wont feel tired. But when it comes to other flowery things like stylish gear knob and switches.....it sucks.I think Toyota ppl have really given all durability and reliabilty but forgot internal decoration. Verdict: Sacrificing some cosmetic effects for long term usage and comfort is OK. You cant have that much boot space in Dezire. I had used both cars. Etios is consensus winner.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Engine quality is superb as compared to its compititors and can even give higher end 10Lac cars a run for their money. Those ppl who want to buy a car and keep it for 8 - 10 yrs minimum should buy this. Coz it wont be outdated or out performed. Fuel economy is satisfactory and ger box is better than Dezire. I think going for Dezire where money is mainly for cosmetic effects and not for durability is a foolish choice. Just compare specifications and you'll see for yourself.
Ride Quality & Handling
Excellent and smooth. Total feel of driving a sedan class. 
 
Final Words
 Dont buy a car coz some neighbour or office collegue has bought it. Research for yourself. If you compare Dezire, Amaze and ETIOS, then you'll find that ETIOS is a clear winner in every field. Toyota has outperformed Maruti and Honda. Though Maruti appears economic but in reality if you compare specifications and price, you'll find that Maruti is fooling the customer and Amaze has clearly cut down on specifications. While Toyota delivers engine performance, Space and Comfort. Its the car for wise ppl. I am happy that i chose ETIOS G over Dezire Vxi and Amze MT.

Full Review 
Well I bought Etios G petrol car on 1st May 2015. Now crossed 2000 km and writing the review. Etios is well balanced perfect family sedan car. If you does not worry about mileage and fancy items better consider Etios in your new car list. Its a best car from trusted & world toppest car maker.
Exterior

Outside body doesn't have any stylish curve but have a decent & elegant look. front grille with crome insert and rear crome insert looks awesome. 
Door handle looks odd & small children can easily open the door if unlocked.
15" wheel makes good performance on patholes
Foldable antenna, rear defrogger does their good job
Fog lamp & electric ORVM not included in G version.

Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)

Decent, Neat, simple look. not having any fancy items.
Beige interior color makes more space and elegant look
Dual tone dashboard are good, the plastics are sold & better life
Seat comforts are best. You will not get tired on longer trips
Steering wheel is well balanced design provies good grip on driving.
Central console initialy does not look good but used to live with it.
Speedometer with blue background looks elegant.
Does not have miles to empty & fuel efficiency indicator.
Digital fuel level indicator not proportionated properly.
Digital meters looks like a school childern digital watch.
Music system not included but 2 front ,2 rear speakers & 2 tweeters installed. its a welcome addition (older models doesn't have rear speakers). Speakers are OK . Can not provide rocking sound from pioneer player. But more than enough for normal use.
Boot space & bottle holders are remarkable. can not beat by any competitor.

Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox

Engine is best in class. Pulled my engine upto 140 kmph on Highway after 1500km odo. Good performance. Solid engine from toyota.
Mileage is not upto the competitor. i'm getting avg 15 kmpl on highway (avg 80 - 90 km speed)
superb gearbox ratio. In 3rd gear provdes very good speed range.

Ride Quality & Handling

Steering is very light you will not get tired on long drive, best design from toyota. 
Clutch & brakes are very smooth (tried in diesel variant they are hard).
Upto 100 kmph easiliy can drive the car, good stability even from light weight car.
At 140 kmph loaded with 4 person, stability is ok but under control.
Tyre & engine noise inside cabin is greatly reduced from older versions. but not upto other competitors. 
Suspension is great. for ground clearance i will say till now didn't hit on any speed breaker even at 10kmph.
ABS - EBS not included in G version. But toyota must install in all varient.

Final Words As said before, Etios is sold true sedan car with some minor disadvantages.
Areas of improvement Toyota must improve the engine to get better mileage. Cabin noise should be reduced to zero level. Digital meters & indicators must be fully replaced by high quality elegant look digital meters with more funtion. Door handles should be repalced with pull type handles.

Full Review 
Exterior Looks are subjective, but I adore the Etios' business looks. It will age well with time, not like Hyundai cars that don't age well. Make sure you get the double chrome front grill as it looks majestic. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) They are simple and functional. Nothing is designed to break after few years of operation. The car is not brimming with useless features like Verna and XUV where things break apart after few months of use. I love the cool glovebox that keeps my drinks cool. I love how spacious the interior is - step in Dzire, Honda City, Verna and then into Etios to know what I am talking about - it has great leg room which makes it great for people travelling in the back. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is makkhan and so is the gearbox. Toyota knows how to make great and long lasting engines. I have seen many Etios with 6 lakh kilometers on the ODO and more with no problem at all. Have you ever seen a Hyundai or even a Honda doing that? 
Make sure you go for 'Q' service for getting the service done. These guys will do the service in mere 1-1.5 hour. You can chill in the AC room, watching everything from top. 
Ride Quality & Handling Suspension is excellent and so is the handling. The steering is very responsive. You will never feel tired after hours and hours of journey. I wish they gave armrest in driver seat as Etios is now an expensive car.

Exterior
The car has elegant looks specially when seen sideways. One turn off is the empty space between the tyres and body of the car whcih looks a bit awkward but over all the car is capable of commanding a presence and bolstering the owner's self esteem! The grill could have been better as it gives the car a docile look!
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Space is excellent...leg room / space...shoulder room / space...everything. The boot space is huge and makes the owner proud as we hardly see this capacity in competitor's products.
The car ranks well on comfort though nothing exceptional. With the adjustable steering, the driver can change his stance / posture. It offers the very basic features with the exception of glove box cooling which can be helpful at times. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Engine is powerful, pickup is good. I drove in Shimla region as well as the hilly areas of Uttarakhand but never found the car short of power. In Petrol, the avergae is city was close to 17 a litre which is decent. 
Gear box is smooth but when you get the car to movein 1st gear, it can be jerky at times
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride quality is good. I can assess that with the comfort level of my family: parents, wife and kids...they are a satisfied lot! I feel like riding a horse that is very much in control and in sync with the jockey so handling has not been a problem. 
Final Words
I would say a must have in your stable...qualifies well for a city as well as a long distance car...makes the owner proud. If I have to reconsider this decision that I took in 2011, I will go for it again. i am saying this after clocking almost 26500 km and 4 services later. A low maintenance and zero tantrums vehicle!

Full Review 
Exterior Reasonable overall looks. Rear looks a bit disappointing.Can be better designed so that it will become more competitive.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Extremely spacious,lot of head room and leg room,almost sprawling.High end model should get leather seats by default also the feel should be a bit premium from within,as the feel good factor kind of missing.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Petrol engine very smooth,Gear box also good.
Ride Quality & Handling Very good in both these areas,a tad underweight I feel as at high speed it seems to be in levitation mode.
Final Words Probably no competition in that segment considering the price,very smart product positioning, as in a Toyota sedan,at below RS 8Lakhs. In the overall perspective should have had been a run away success,considering the overall package...But sadly it's not the case.Honda perhaps the clear leader in this segment inspite of premium pricing. So the jury is clearly out that atleast in India people are willing to spend a few lakhs more if they really see value in the product. May be in India Honda will remain aspirational,needless to say they good as anybody in this game.
Areas of improvement Better design will ensure they will get premium pricing. Like the new Corolla Altis which has very good looks.

Full Review 
Exterior Great design and eyecatching appearance
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Super spacious front and rear, great boot area, Average plastics but limited storage slots and spaces
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Below average pertol engine. Too much engine whining noise for a petrol engine. Strange engine sound in first gear.Clutch plate wobbling sensation in first gear. Gear ratios tooo short in lower gears though mid range gears are great. After 80 kmph i felt the need for a 6th gear. Follow me home headlights which were promised are not included in this version. Have not driven a full tank full of mileage to calculate fuel efficiency but am quite sure she will not cross10/11km in the city. Suspension is good but with replaced michelin tyres improved the ride dramatically. Stupid of the company to cut minimal costs on tyres for sake of a comfortable ride and cabin noise. No alarm sensor in security system.
Ride Quality & Handling Petrol RXL version fitted with horrible noisy JK tyres. Spent 12000 extra to replace  michlens which reduced the cabin niose and ride quality IMMENSELY. Spare wheel has no alloy wheel. Noisy cabin with engine and tyre noise is quite irritating.
Final Words Nice effort by renault to produce a premium mid range sedan but as a customer for the price i feel the company has fallen way short of a buyers expectations . Average car overall but the few points mentioned above make me feel cheated. Horrible job by dealer to fit art leather seats and leather cover for steering. No leather gear knob job done either. No chrome front grill in stock. Have to return to the dealer again.
Areas of improvement Dealer delivered car without mud flaps and car cover asking me to come back a week later even after colleccting the charges. No enthusiasm in the staff. Generally a Bad buying experience. No professionalism sorry to say.

Exterior Front looks rather dull, however the rear styling gives the car a classy look.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space is good. Seats are comfortable and upholstery is good. Shock Absorbers are fine and absorb a lot of bumps that other cars of this segment except City dont do as good.
Ride Quality & Handling This is where the car completely fails. I have owned and driven a number of cars of this segment, and Ciaz is the worst of all.
The Petrol Automatic Version: the Engine noise inside the cabin is way too much. Its almost as if you are driving a diesel Engine car.
The Handling is not just bad, but rather dangerous. Its for this reason I would not recommend buying this car. The steering of the car is way too swift and does not self-center. This is a simple and basic feature a car of this segment should have. I own a Honmda City and an Elantra,and the self-centering of the steeering in these two cars is perfect, With any speed and any angle of turn ,the steering orients itself to the centre to make for safe and easy driving.
However in the Ciaz, if you take a turn, as simple as a lane change, the steering tends to stay in the position of the turn and does not self centre. You have to pull it back manually to the centre position. This greatly affect the straight line stability of the car and not only makes for very uncomfortable but also dangerous driving at any speed and in traffic.
This was pointed out to the guys at Spectra Motors the very next day after taking the delivery of the car. They however responded after 3 weeks and that too only after I complained to Maruti Helpline.
Their technician came and took a  test drive of the car, and said that probably the problem lies with the with the model itself. I had test driven the Ciaz before buying and the problem wasnt to be seen in the test car. So we drove the test car again with the salesman of Spectra Motors and  technician Mr. Sujit of Spectra. Mr. Sujit after that was of the opinion(after driving my car when he too could not control it well after a slight lane change kind of turn and would have banged the car into the side walk) that there is a issue that needs to be addressed. They took the car to the showroom and did some repair work, and returned the car after 3 days. When I rode the car again, I only felt a slight improvement in the performance, with the steering self centering at higher sppeds but not below 60, which still made for dangerous driving.
This was then pointed out to Mr. Dhumal (workshop manager) of Spectra and Mr. Sujit, who recommened that this is the way any car works. I then showed him my Honda City with a perfect Self-Centering steering and he said I should compare a "Maruti to a Maruti". So we test drove a very old Wagon R of a neighbour, the Self Centering of which was much better and made for a safe driving. Upon this Mr. Sujit said that they have repaired the car as per Maruti Specs and there is nothing more they can do. If the car does not self-center, then maybe thats how it is designed.
They also showed the car to one Mr. Akbar from Maruti who said that the car is fine. They in fact told me that may be the problem is only with this specific model of Ciaz as no one else is complaining.  So if there is a model specific problem, does that make it OK and isnt it your job to resolve it???
This is not my first car, but definitely the last one from Maruti. Not only is this car a bad design, but also the attitude of Maruti is the typical "chalta hain types" where in I end up being the loser. My use of this car will end up being limited only in the city where I neways wont be able to drive at high speeds because it would be very dangerous to drive the car at high speeds and Maruti is not interested in repairing it.
Final Words Do not buy this car. Its not safe to handle. Note that there is another review on this forum which has mentioned that the car has a self centering problem. I hope Maruti is listening and would do something about this.
Areas of improvement Engine Performance and Handling, and attitude of authorised dealers and workshops. Some ownership of a mistake would do good for the company.

Exterior After a long wait , with lot of excietment,  Maruti launched a new Sedan - Ciaz, we were lucky to get delivery before Diwali.
It looks a hybrid of SX4 and new City and it doesn't impress you on exteriors however you will not be disappointed by its first looks. .
After a more thorough examination you will find it has some good exterior features like telescopic headlamps, indicators on ORVMs (internally adjustable) in lower versions also like that of mine, etc.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) What impresses is greaaattt space both in front and back. I drove down to Jaipur from Delhi and back with my family and It was a great confortable drive for us. Including me, we were total five members (we all are tall in my family) in the car and no body complained about the discomfort. Great legroom and not to forget its extra spacious boot.
My car (Vxi+) is definately loaded with many features which are usually not found in many cars at entery level versions. Finishing inside is also good, Maruti should have more focused on finishing on the interiors of doors which gives cheap plastic feel. 2 din music system with 6 speakers is really beauty.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Except for its hard transmission, driving Ciaz is a pleasure. Till now in 11 days I have driven it around 850Kms and the average of around 17Kms/Ltr has come as a pleasent surprise to me. If it is 17Kms/Ltr in the mixed condition w/o even first service than who needs a diesel car. 
Though petrol engine is just OK, however sometimes it lacks in power and demands for a slightly more powerful engine.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good. Can't comment much on handling except being lengthy, car needs to be driven with extra care on roads to avoid any brush-ups.
Final Words Maruti has come out with a good sedan which is feature rich at a very very competitive price. Looking at its price, its minor shortcomings can be easiely ignored.

Exterior Similar to honda city and hyundai verna, but no doubt maruti came up which was never expected. The longest in C Segment Sedan. Quite happy with exterior looks.  
Well if one can add some spoiler and side skirts, then it will look the best modified car ever. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very much satisified with the amount of features I recevied in the base model. I really got whatever I wanted it. I am not satisfied with the key received since I was expecting a Smart KEy in all models.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Well, I havent driven much. Just made a run of about 250 Km uptill now with a tank recharge of 2000 Rs. So the overall economy received uptill now is around 15Km/litre. Can expect to increase after the service.
Ride Quality & Handling Car absorbs all the potholes and bump so smoothly. Much better than Hyundai Verna and Honda City. Second thing its a low maintenance as compared to others.
Final Words It was worth waiting for it.I really enjoy my new car. If you a pure C Segment Sedan Experience just go ahead with Ciaz.

Full Review 
Well let me start by saying that I firmly believe CIAZ is the best offering from the Maruti Suzuki stables as yet! I was one of the very first customers of the CIAZ in Pune and am damn proud of it. I waited till I did a couple of drives down to Mumbai and stretched her legs properly before penning my thoughts abouts owning the car. Now a bit more detail!

Exterior - Elegantly styled the CIAZ captivates the onlooker immediately with it's presence. Projector Head Lamps included curvaceous headlights look stunning and compliment the Chrome front grille beautifully. The rear end though many may feel is similar to that of the new City (even copied some might add) I far better designed. Especially the fender and the cluster of lights in the tail lights. The 15" wheel caps (VXi+) looks so similar to the 16" Alloys on the higher end variants that it takes a keen eye to realise they are covers and not alloys.  The ORVMs with the indicators integrated on them add to the classy look.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) - What can I say? It beats the City hands down!! Styling, feature list, space you name it! City I'm sure hs many a loyal fan and not without reason till date but here is a car that challenges the till date segment leader and I dare say wins the battle. The entertainment system looks far better in the CIAZ and so does the overall Dashboard. The seats are super comfortable and provide excellent support all over for longer drives. Rear AC and charging points, arm rest and the leg room in the back is just unbelievable. My fiend infact seeing the space asked me to show him the boot to see if Maruti Suzuki designers played a trick here but BAM! The boot is huge too! The steering with audio and phone controls feels great and super convenient. The bluetooth took some time to for me to understand but maybe because I tried to experiment instead of reading the manual! (That's me!) Cruise Control would have been a nice rounding off to the feature list, but I dont see it as a deal breaker for sure!
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox - The engine is smooth and refined as expected from Maruti Suzuki. The K-Series engine gives a great balance of power and ecomony. Company claims 20+ average but I am getting around 15 in city conditions and Pune traffic sucks!! Highway average goes right up close to company claimed. Overall around 17KMPL is great I would say in the Real World. The gearbox is smooth altough initially I did find it a bit tough to select Reverse.
 
Ride Quality & Handling - The ride quality is lovely too! The bumps and ditches synonymous to indian roads are tackled well and the handling at speeds of 140+ km/h on the Express Highway didn't scare the wits out of me. The car handled the curves in the ghat sections brilliantly at 100 K's too! Ground clearance is also good ensuring the bottom isn't getting scraped on the hideous "speed breakers" around town.
 
Final Words - Overall I would say this is probably the best buy I have made in terms of cars bought as yet since even some Merc and BMW owners actually truned aroud to give a second look to my beauty when I passed them by in Pune and Mumbai. Now that's got to be a Compliment if there was one! Sorry McDonalds I'm stealing your line - I'm Loving It!
 
Areas of improvement - Today's customers are vowed by things like Sunroofs and Cruise Control! Try incorporating them maybe as "Optional" features for a reasonable price. Also please do launch the rear windscreen retractable curtain under the Maruti Genuine Spares (MGS) list. It makes huge sense to have one in our climatic conditions especially on long drives.

Exterior The car looks beautiful when viwed from outside. It is very well designed. Honda city is not that good looking and Hundai Verna is a bit overstyled. Ciaz is a good looking car from all aspects.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The metrial in the inter is quite premium. It looks fabulous. There is a lot of space and alsoi has a good height. I missed the telescopic steering that verna has. Also the sunroof that City has. But from all other aspects the car is better those cars.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The 1.4L K-series engine is extremly good. You wont miss the 1.5L engine and 1.6L engine that you get in Verna especially in cities and towns. The small difference doesn't matter.
The gear shift is smooth and easy to use. The car has a good fuel economy. In city I get 15kmpl and in highways nearly 18kmpl.
Ride Quality & Handling The car is fun to drive and i have no complaints regarding handling.
Final Words I have driven about 1000 km and found the car is fun to drive. If you want to buy a City or Verna then you must think of Ciaz at least once. Overall i am satisfied with what i have bought.

Exterior Excellent exterior at first glance, Wait for 3 to 4 months and walla we have a car looking 5 years old. feels like maruti has used the cheapest possible paint. My car has started rusting in places which the paint was intact. i wonder how? 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) At first i felt lucky 5 months down the line you will need a awesome music system to make it bareable to drive this car . Every thing in the cabin makes noise. I literally start holding things to see from where its rattelling. I wonder if maruti used plastic from recycled buckets to make its interior.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is ok , alittle on the noisy side but with all the noise in the cabin from the interior you will hardly notice.
Fuel Economy I cannot comment on, in 5 months i have driven it only 2650 km ( i guess all those kilometers were to the service center and back).
Lets talk about the gear box, I had a swift Dezire VXI before this and thought that car was not upto the mark, As it was the cheapest sedan to me so i sold it to buy the ciaz but this car is worse than the Dezire in all respects even the gear shift .
Ride Quality & Handling To let you know how the Ciaz Suspension is, take an empty can put some marbles in it and shake. Thats the noise my suspension make just after 2650 km and this noise is present from day1. I bought the car the very next day showed it to the dealer he advised me to show the servuce center. went to the service center they told me come for the first srevice as parts are not avaliable and we will solve the problem. Had the entire suspention changed [ thats atleast what the service center told me ]. Drove the car, problem was still the same, Spoke to the manager he said there is a team comming from Delhi we will get the car inspected, But according to him "Sir it is a normal manufacturing defect, If there are more complains the company will solve it, most people who buy this car have drivers, you are a little paticular and drive it yourself thats why you notice". The car was ispected and given back, but i have not heared from maruti since then. Kept in touch with the service center for a while and they till now have been convincing me that i am the only one that has this problem . Recently went to my old service center which also is an authorised maruti service center to see if they could figure out the problem. It has been 6 months and i am still waiting
Final Words After reading my testimonial would you really want to spen your hard earned cash for this pile of junk... I want to sell this car but i am really feeling horrible that i would be selling a car which i bet the new buyer would also hate.. Even if the problem is ever solved and i know i am an optimist for wishfull thinking .....
NEVER EVER A MARUTI AGAIN...

I have purchased Ciaz Zxi petrol around a month back. After driving about 2000 Kms, I am submitting this review. The new Ciaz has real elegant looks. The front chrome grill , split tail lamps , aerodynamic shape adds to its styling.
This car is very stable on highways at 140 kmph speed.
The noiseless petrol engine, Automatic climate control AC , bluetooth and audio controls on steering wheels supports a very comfortable driving experience. More space , rear AC vents adds to comfortable back seat long drive.
Pick up is very good. I never felt this machine underpower at any point.
This car has given me mileage of 17.5 kmpl on highway and around 15 kmpl in the city driving conditions.
Best Features - Keyless entry , Push button start and stop , Rear sunshade, Projector Headlamps, Height adjustable drivers seat, large boot space.
Needs to improve - Nothing as such.
Overall, I am a satisfied owner of this stylish, elegent and featureful sedan from Maruti Suzuki at this price. Its really value for money and a must buy.

Full Review 
 
This is my third car after the esteem and the 2004 honda city. Had pre booked it without looking at it or knowing what the package would be like. Have purchased the Petol VX+ version with airbags and auto ac . Frankly was surprised with the package that i got. It had all the frills expected from a car in this price range. What surprised me was the space, which is more than both my previous cars.  Just wished they had priced it a little lower by around 50k ( thats what i expected when i pre booked it ) 
Exterior
Large high exterior , which is taller than its compatriots in the same segment gives the car a bold strong look. While the front seems a mash up between the dzire/ baleno, the back seems similiar to the city. However the taller and slightly longer body gives the car a much bigger look and a more premium feel 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
No complaints in the space. I am a 6 footer and keep my driver chair almost on par with the middle pillar, still there is 6 inches of legroom left in the back when another 6 foot person is sitting there. This car has enourmous space and feels roomy with the beige interiors  
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
The engine is smooth ,much more than i expected. Hardly makes a noise. The only flaw i found is that one has to rev hard to give the car fast pickup. With slow revs , it takes a little time to hit hundred, but guess that imporves the economy. If you increase the RPM in the lower gears, the car can shoot ahead . I owned a honda previously and have even driven the new 2014 honda model, and both needed to be pushed hard to get the accelaration, just like this car. But the maruti has a weaker engine so needed a greater press on the pedal, but performed with equal gusto . 
I Got a fantastic mileage of 20+ on the highway, with mileage within the city between 13 to 14 with AC. Feel thats ok for a petrol engine 
Ride Quality & Handling
Adequate ride quality and abosrbed most of the bumps. The few that it didnt must be because of the craters on mumbai roads. Drove the car till 150kph and didnt feel any vibrations . The steering is soft and light , much lighter than the new city  
Final Words
 The car is good, maybe they could have given the front a more different look. The miser in me wishes they had priced it less by another 50,000/- . Then they would have licked the competiotion 
Areas of improvement  
The front sytling could have been different. An while it is easy to ask for a more powerful engine, that would be at the cost of mileage .

Exterior Quit good. Though conventional but a clean design. Side profile gives a feeling one class above compare to its competitors.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) This is the best part of the car, nice clean and slick design. everything just in place with full of features. Huge leg room. Extra under thigh support could have been better.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I have driven more than 1000 km, I did not fell at all any lack of power contrary to the other reviews. It has quite good pull. 0-80 is quite quick. Though above 3000 rpm engine noise comes into the cabin. Maruti could have done a better job here. Best part is fuel economy, in petrol version I am getting 20+ on expressway. Gearbox is short but little notchy.
Ride Quality & Handling I used to drive Optra which is much heavier car and I used to get the feeling of much more stable and grounded, this is much lighter car which does not give same confidence like optra. Steering is too light which I don't like. But very good for city driving. Suspension is good, nicely absorbers small pot holes, bump etc. Steering is precise during cornering, but felt little body role.
Final Words Overall very nice package under 10 lakhs. It's hands down winner against the competition. I love it.

Exterior No nonsense design, european styling, sleek looks, projector lamps, long wheelbase.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Enormous space, superior comfort, good ride quality.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel economy is unquestionable, I guess its the talk of the town, my colleagues asked me the mileage and they double dropped their jaws after my response. my car gives me a massive 18kmpl on the highway and a decent 12 in bumper to bumper city traffic. overall mileage figures are 14.5 kmpl and my car is just 4 weeks old and I expect it to go up after 5000 kms. Gear box is slick and shifting is creamy.
Engine is a little underpowered but you won't feel the need for it unless you want to race a car side by. as long as you are driving on your own and as per your own pace and don;t intend to beat the hell out of some other car you would never realise the under powered engine of ciaz. so if you are a family guy who prefers to drive safe and even, it would hardly matter to you.
Ride Quality & Handling The ride quality is awesome, it takes the biggest of potholes and speed breakers with ease and does not let the thud afftect the passengers inside. the drive is even and quite settled even on high speed drives and speeds in excess of 100KMPH.
Handling is apt and the car does not disaapoint you. it is quiet obedient and rarely misbehaves. the steering is chunky and confidence enhancing and manouvering is not a herculian task even on narrow city roads.
Final Words The CIAZ is a wonderful product from the maruti stable and the one that could give the leaders in this segment a run for it money. being almost 1.5 lakh cheaper than the top spec of honda city and almost 80k cheaper than the top spec of verna, this car values your hard earned bucks. space is awesome, boot is by far the largest in this segment and the length ensures that you get a feel of car a notch above than its class. sometimes parking is a issue coz of this massive length, but the rps and the camera do help you a lot. acceleration from stand still is decent and quiet responsive, mid level and top level punch is where you feel the underpowered engine, but overall the drive is smooth and you won't be disappointed. go for it if you are looking for a classy sedan with good space.
Areas of improvement They could add some more features like cruise control and sunroof to maximise its value.

Exterior
 Projector Headlamps, Nice flow of line from the side till the rear, looks bigger and different design when compare to other Maruthi Models. Keyless entry works really good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
EVery thing is good. Console box with closure, rear sun shade, rear AC vents, good audio system. Dont have any thing to say about negative.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Even though power is lesser in this segment, i don't feel underpower. I didn't go above 100, but touched 100 easily. Will try above this after first service. city drive is really good. Engine noise creeps into the cabin when you rev it hardly, but when you drive in between 2 to 3k, you don't get that noise and easily touchs 100KM with this range.
Ride Quality & Handling
Pot holes are easily taken and i didn't find any issue. Ride Qualitry is good
Final Words
VFM, Petrol vehicle with almost 20KM/L in Highways and around 14KM/L in city with the size of this car, its a good buy.

 Comforatble with ample leg space for 3 tall people, good rear cooling, charger units and glass holders, rear window defogger, suitable for all types of highway, and have driven it even in the hills without discomfort. The tilting steering and drivers seat adjustment are a dream for tall people. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Pickup when required on overtaking on highway needs improvement ( difficult to overtake on highways with traffic due to lack of immediate response from engine ), fuel economy excellent, cabin ride superb except when on short length bad roads on highways even at medium speeds. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Suspension should be improved to tackle bumps at even medium speeds on highways and in city roads, especailly roads like Bangalore Roads.
Final Words
 Am very happy with my buy, and will surely recommend it to my friends planning to buy a car soon, but request Maruti to fine tune these small points mentioned above.
Areas of improvement  
 Engine power in bursts required, suspension. nothing more. Excellent vehicle overall.

Final Words
 I purchased this car in Kolkata in November and it has been in the garage for engine problems ever since. The Last time the Maruti garage people said that they had replaced several sensors in the engine after consulting with the factory in Delhi. They promised it would solve all the ongoing problems. This was about ten days ago and today the car would not start leaving my wife stranded and having to take a taxi home. I am sick to death of this car and wish I had never bought it. Don't be fooled by the good looks! it's a dud. DO NOT BUY!!! Also we were told by the Maruti service people here that we would have to pay to have the car towed to the garage for repair or alternatively we would have to pay our own mechanic to fix the car at the break down site. So not only does the car suck, so does the after sale service!!
Areas of improvement  
 I can only hope that Maruti will offer a replacement because my experiance with this heap is absolutely unacceptable.

I have purchased Ciaz Zxi petrol on April 2nd 2015. After driving about 3,500 Kms and also a long drive from Hyderabad to Chennai I am submitting this review. The new Ciaz has real elegant looks. The front chrome grill , split tail lamps , aerodynamic shape adds to its styling.
This car is very stable on highways at 120 kmph speed.
The noiseless petrol engine, Automatic climate control AC , bluetooth and audio controls on steering wheels supports a very comfortable driving experience. More space , rear AC vents adds to comfortable back seat long drive.
Pick up is very good. I never felt this machine underpower at any point.
This car has given me mileage of 17.0 kmpl on highway .
Best Features - Keyless entry , Push button start and stop , Rear sunshade, Projector Headlamps, Height adjustable drivers seat, large boot space.
Needs to improve - There is nothing much to improve. However I have noticed fuel pump noice as soon as we start the engine, I really dont know whether it is common in all vehicles or with my vehicle.
Overall, I am a satisfied owner of this stylish, elegent and featureful sedan from Maruti Suzuki at this price. Its really value for money and a must buy.

Exterior Aerodyanamic design - feels like floating on the road. Stylish Projector lamps , Front grill could have been redesigned.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Gives the feel of a premium vehicle , good leg space both at the rear and front. The head space is bit low at front (for person >6.2" ft it will hit your head)
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel economy is perfect, am getting 15.5 KMPL in city drive and 19.4 KMPL in long Distance.
Engine is bit underpowered , hence unable to beat Honda city in its initial pick up. But on Highways Ciaz Makes the way but inch on inch. Gear box is pretty smooth for the petrol version.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent , but the tire noise makes it bit uneasy , sterio volume at 8 gives you excellent ride quality. Steering retract after full turn is bit slow - may b of the length of the vehicle
Final Words Ciaz is an awesome vehcile and has given me full value for the money and i would consider it as best value sedan when compared to City and Verna. Ciaz and City are tough compertitors.
Areas of improvement If Maruti could bring an engine of 1.6 L and with good power along with fuel economy of >16 KMPL ,Honda City will be vanished. Ensure that the cabin noise is minimized.

dont buy ZXI+ with GPS as system doesnot work at all


Full Review 
Dear All,
Please dont buy Ciaz ZXI i bought this model on 22nd october 2015. i bought this model over ZXI is due to GPS.
1. GPS is flop & as not of any use.
2. the entire infotainment system doesn't have remote control even at extra cost. Sales people told me you have to download software on mobile & operate from it. I don't know who will do this. assuming i am sitting back & talking on phone how will operate remote from mobile so its complete nonsense.
3. sitting position at driver seat - Even if i drive for 1 hour my upper back pains. i drove my last car(Dzire) which is sold to true value maruti 117000km. i never had this problem in whole 5.5years. Please let me know how to over come this??????
GPS-This system itself is joke. i was amazed when i went to showroom Kothari wheels viman nagar sales people was not aware how to use this system. they were equally surprised to see the system not functioning as per we searched places on mobile. even my apartment in Pune & Mumbai is not shown on the screen.
Initially I thought that system is not upgraded i went to following service stations of Maruti to find out & update the system 1. Shivam autozone Mumbai Kandivali
2. Kothari wheels - viman nagar
3. Sai service - Wagholi pune
Finally sai service wagholi gave me number of one of the person of Sai service Deccan who was having software & aware of the system. I felt like finally I found scientist for this system. people at Kothari wheel showroom saying that person at hadapasar service center who is not available for 8 days so nothing can be done. I was not aware that maruti is running entire show on 1 or 2 people. further as per Maruti its standard feature & it will show only whats loaded in the maps & not where we wish to go. Dont even think about buying it.

Full Review 
Exterior After a long wait , with lot of excietment,  Maruti launched a new Sedan - Ciaz, we were lucky to get delivery before Diwali.
It looks a hybrid of SX4 and new City and it doesn't impress you on exteriors however you will not be disappointed by its first looks. .
After a more thorough examination you will find it has some good exterior features like telescopic headlamps, indicators on ORVMs (internally adjustable) in lower versions also like that of mine, etc.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) What impresses is greaaattt space both in front and back. I drove down to Jaipur from Delhi and back with my family and It was a great confortable drive for us. Including me, we were total five members (we all are tall in my family) in the car and no body complained about the discomfort. Great legroom and not to forget its extra spacious boot.
My car (Vxi+) is definately loaded with many features which are usually not found in many cars at entery level versions. Finishing inside is also good, Maruti should have more focused on finishing on the interiors of doors which gives cheap plastic feel. 2 din music system with 6 speakers is really beauty.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Except for its hard transmission, driving Ciaz is a pleasure. Till now in 11 days I have driven it around 850Kms and the average of around 17Kms/Ltr has come as a pleasent surprise to me. If it is 17Kms/Ltr in the mixed condition w/o even first service than who needs a diesel car.
Though petrol engine is just OK, however sometimes it lacks in power and demands for a slightly more powerful engine.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good. Can't comment much on handling except being lengthy, car needs to be driven with extra care on roads to avoid any brush-ups.
Final Words Maruti has come out with a good sedan which is feature rich at a very very competitive price. Looking at its price, its minor shortcomings can be easiely ignored.
Areas of improvement Engine pick up..and some on exterior..over all the car is very good and if u want ot purchase it once u should purchase this car for maximum u can hold this car for seven years.

Full Review 
Exterior Company cheated by advertising that highest model has larger wheels of 16" alloys. But it never disclosed that the spare wheel is not only 'non-alloy' but also smaller in size (both in height and the width!). 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interiors are good. Quality of plastics is good. Music system is quite average. Reception of FM particularly is worse than Indica Vista that i used to drive!
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Drive is smooth but one feels significantly under-powered. Fuel economy is about 14.5 on an average and about 15.5 on highway
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is good. Handling at high speeds doesnt inspire confidence as steering is too light. Gear shift is not that good. My car had a trouble within a day of purchasing. Maruti did change some part but it didnt improve much
Final Words Overall decent car - not at all for driving enthusiats who love to have strong power under their feet. DO NOT BUY the TOP Variant
Areas of improvement Company should disclose that tyre sizes are unequal.

I have purchased the Car in October 2014....happy with the car but disappointed with service from Magic Auto, Mayapur, New Delhi
 
Service experience from Magic Auto, Mayapuri, New Delhi is extremely bad. Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) uses Net Promoter Score (NPS) as measurement of customer satisfaction. Magic Auto tries to lure customer with freebies to buy the good feedback (NPS). In short, they buy the feedback.
My experience with Mayapuri service centre (Magic Auto)
1. Customer finds big posters with phone number of Service Head to reach out in case of any complaint. But Service Head keeps his office cell phone in switched off mode. He is not even respond to emails if you send at the email ID given on the poster. Raising the concerns to MD also doesn't work.
2. Post service cleaning and polishing is done by people wearing leather jackets, the zip can cause scratches
3.Incomplete job done...I have asked to clean all doors from inside. None of the doors were cleaned at the time of delivery. They assured to get this task completed while I do billing. But then cleaned only two of them.
4. No transparency. No mechanism to ensure if Tyre rotation was done or not. Adviser assured me to put some identification marks but then did't do it.     
5. Magic Auto service representative will insist to come to you home to help you fill the online feedback form from Maruti Suzuki and they will offer a free gift. Actually they will come to get 10 ratings out 10. MSIL takes this feedback seriously for the dealers but dealers has found this way to get the good feedback

Exterior The exterior styling is conservative when compared to a Vierna. The rear looks very similar to the City. Overall i find the car pleasing to look at.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Checks all the right boxes but one. I wanted the navigation system but i didn't want to pay extra for the rims and seat covers. I decided to wait it out for the time being hoping that MS will give the option of replacing the head unit at a later time.
The space here is best in class. Back support and comfort leave nothing more to be desired. Some people say that the City has better under thigh support but it didn't seem to make a difference to me. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The engine seems eager, to my surprise. My car is just 3 days old and i am being very gentle with it. I have decided to drive within the 2k RPM limit. The car drives at 80 KMPH at 2K RPM.
The 3rd gear is all purpose. Pulls from low speeds and can manage without too many gear shifts. OEM has done a great job with the gear ratios.
Fuel economy on the indicator is on the upswing. It's currently at 13 kmpl in the city with AC on 100% of the time. It is getting even better!
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is excellent. Very happy with the suspension and GC. The car handles very well. The only draw back i feel is that the steering is not lively enough. It is not eager to return to position after a turn or U-turn.
Final Words The car brings a smile to my face. It drive is no longer as stressful even in b2b traffic. 
Areas of improvement Steering feedback.
Accessories: Voice and navigation unit should be available. Colour options in the bumper and door protectors.

Exterior Exterior is fantastic,what you are going to pay to honda or hyundai.Maruti is giving you the same thing at a very less price because its Indian manufactured.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Climate control ac, power windows ABS and all the features are available at a economy, if u purchase a few interior accesories it makes a comfort saloon and its perfect for day to day utilisation and attracts who so ever takes a ride.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine in petrol version is powerfull enough even if u drive in a hilly terrian, I've not driven diesel variant. Milege is good and overall maintenance cost is low as compared to manufacturers like skoda or honda where u pay ample amount at workshops
Ride Quality & Handling Handling with 16 inch alloys is superb and ride quality can very well be felt wen u dont feel any noise or jerks even or rough roads.  
Final Words Overall I would say if u spend too much money on other manufacturers then you will get features which maruti is offering a lower price with quality as good as any other car in market.Moreover you never know even german volkswagen is prooved to be a big cheater. Atleast u can trust maruti which is almost in india for 30 years.
Areas of improvement Engine power may be enhanced.

Exterior I purchased ZXi model. Its completely keyless operative. Back portion is like new Honda City. Fornt part is line SX4. Overall good look from ouside. It come with full loaded.... reverse parking sensers, camera etc.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is fabulous. Complete luxurious feeling. Ample leg room for front and rear passengers. Interior features are wonderful. Blue-tooth works fine, easily talk over phone without disturbance. Good music system (radio, CD drive, usb and aux) with six speakers. Enough number of pockets for bottles, wallet and
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox 1.4 L, K- series engine is quite smooth and delivers linear power. Never felt under power. I completed first 1000 kms in 3 days only. I got fuel economy with AC on, around 19.2 kms/lit on highways. Gear shifting is smooth except some times reverse gear gives little problem.
Ride Quality & Handling I enjoyed the driving with my CIAZ. Parking sensors and camera work absolutely fine (To take reverse in congested space is become easy). Steering mounted controls make job more easy to operate phone or music system.
Final Words Maruti- Sai Service at Goa is fantastic. They gave delivery of car within 20 days after the booking. After-sales service is also good. Maruti CIAZ fulfills need of Indian customers. Finally it is value for money.
Areas of improvement Reverse gear gives little problem and can be rectified.

Exterior This beauty define class. Very attractive exteriors, specifically the tail. This car looks best in white. I wanted to buy silver and end up buying ciaz in white but no regret. It looks amazing in this color.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) I took test drive of almost every cars in this segment and no doubt this one is the most spacious. It has ample space for leg room both in front and back. Very comfortable and must buy for someone who drives with family. The boot is big and can easily store 4 big suitcases and 3 hand bags. I was told by many people that this car is not powerful and it's not worth the price but i must say i am driving it since 30th March, 2015 and done 600km so far and very happy with performance.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I drove to a speed of 110 so far and you don't feel the speed it's so steady and no noise of engine. I have ZXi (Petrol) and giving me a mileage of 15 and hope to improve after 1st service. Gear box is smooth, it gives you a sound when you change gear which gives you a feel of driving sports car.
Final Words Suzuki keep it up.

Bluetooth connectivity works fine. i tried it with Apple and blackberry both. it works absolutely fine.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I am happy about its performance, pick up and fuel effeciency.
Ride Quality & Handling Silky smooth, doesnt hit on the same speed breaker where my friend's honda city hits its bottom

Exterior
Superb styling and looks great from every angle. It indeed is a head turner on the roads, attracts a lot of second looks and makes people curious. Maruti has got the styling right, looks indeed modern and contemporary. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
The best in its class so far, superb beige & black dual tone interiors. Excellent stock audio system and so is the blutooth handsfree setup. Class leading space especially the rear bench, 5 adults can comfortably travel, ample leg room for all. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Contrary to reviews, this engine works really well for this car. Although on paper the BHP numbers are less than Honda civic, the car never felt underpowered in city or highway speeds. The fuel economy is one of the highlights of this car, I am getting close 17+ on a city/highway mixed driving conditions. The engine is super quiet and hardly any noise filters into the cabin. Except for the tyre noise on a concrete roads, there is absolutely no noise. 
Ride Quality & Handling
Maruti has done its homework well on the ground clearance and overall NVH levels and hence the ride is probably the best in class. Fantastic ride and superb handling. 
Final Words
Best in class, excellent fuel economy, value for money. Highly recommended. For those still on the fence, please carry out a back-to-back test drive of Ciaz and whatever other car and then go with your heart. With Maruti you just cannot go wrong.
Areas of improvement   
Wish the Zxi+ was available readily.

Exterior  Very pleasing and appealing.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Aesthetically and ergonomically designed with comfort in mind. Big boot.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Got about 18.2 kmpl on a long journey on expressway which is quite good. Within the NCR  the mileage I am getting  is about 16 kmpl. Expected  to improve since present reading on my odometer is only 1200kM. 
No problems faced with gear box however the clutch is slightly hard.
Ride Quality & Handling Experiencing  slight sway and rocking on wavery  roads- may be the suspension, mountings etc. Need a check up by Maruti experts.
Final Words Expecting Maruti Engineers to look into the reason for cabin noise for which  I have requested through their web site. Nevertheless CIAZ is a wonderful car and VFM.
Areas of improvement Not an expert to comment. I will come back with more reviews after driving for some more time and distance.

Exterior Beauty is a subjective matter though,but I find it very stylish.  not as futuristic as a city or a verna but still better than many of its peers.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Nice interiors with good quality plastic used(don't listen to guys who say the opposite..they have'nt been inside a city yet), good contols, awesome AC and a decent quality music system(i beieve JVC). The only set back is the seat quality..a better thigh support would have been great..not bad though still.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox All the users keep on blabbering about the engine performance of the car that its not as good as city's or verna's. this mahcine has been made for a better mileage and comfort to begin with. all the tweeks have been made accordingly.If you are a torque lover, go buy a ford classic or something.So, keep this is mind when you go for a test drive.and its not that bad either.
Ride Quality & Handling Awesome ride quality. I drove home to HP from Delhi(almost 500 kms). I did'nt feel a hint of tiredness all through. Also, at 160km/hr the car was stable and confident. nice control on the curves too. Also, its me an average of 600 kms in 2000 bucks. what else is needed.
Final Words Reiterating. dont go for the car if you're particularly looking for engine/performance/speed/pick up, blah blah..or else, take a TD and bring it home. finally, is it that bad if u save a large chunk on the after saels??
Areas of improvement The engine makes noise post 2000 RPM mark. enuff said.

Full Review 
Exterior.Nice clean and sleek design. Everything just in place. Though the Rear end looks more like Honda City.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Features and interiors manifest a luxurious feel and the seating  very comfortable. Smart Key. Infotainment system give a feel of higher segment Car. However Navigation system and Smart Phone system need updating to  synch with all brands of Smart phones and Google Map.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Performance  in City traffic  is excellent without having to make frequent gear  shift. Reaching speed upto 100 kms/hour was smooth and engine very responsive. However on highways and open roads felt a bit under powered while trying to drive over 120 Km/hour. Who needs that kind of speed on Indian roads ???
Fuel Efficiency. Drove the Ciaz for about 1800 Kms . 600 Kms in City stop and go traffic and 1200Kms on National Highways. Got an average mileage of 18.5 Kms. Drove Bangalore - Hyderabad (600 Kms) with a tank full. Was left with quarter tank Plus Approximately 13-15 ltrs still in the tank. That makes it about 20 Kms/Ltr as promised.
Ride Quality & Handling Suspension system is good, Good  road clearance enable smooth going over road humps, Rides the bumps and pot holes smoothly. 
Final Words Happy to have bought this Excellent Value for Money Family Sedan.
Areas of improvement Improve Engine power for those looking for a car to enter Formula One racing.

Exterior
 Exterior is decent, one of the best from maruti till now and justifies C segment slot well.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Most of the features are in, comfortable seating and bigger pot holes and raod humps are well handled without giving goose bumps to passenger inside.
I hear body noise when riding over pot holes in the back, whihc I think to do with poor body built, at times you feel the body is too hollow.
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Lags initial pick-up, overtaking is a concern indeed since the power does not surge straight away when you step the throttle, engine makes lot of noise beyond 3000 rpm.
Good Fuel Economy, I have driven 1000 Km's, getting 17.5 in highway and 16 in city.
 
Ride Quality & Handling
 Good.
Final Words
 Poor body built.

Exterior It does make heads turn!! I can see people looking at car at red lights. Bikers trying to read model and looking at car from all angles. Even at petrol station( Mine was among the firsts in Bangalore), the attendants gathered around to see the car
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Excellent space. Good entertainment system with speakers 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel Economy is good. 14.3Km/L with AC.  Need to floor the pedal to floor in highway, but excellent for city driving.
Ride Quality & Handling Good ride quality.
Final Words Overall a very satisfied customer. I was advised by my friend to not to buy suzuki, as I my previous cars were also from Maruti(800 and swift). But after test driving various cars like Renault scala, Hyundai verna, skoda rapid, Nissan sunny, Volkswagen Vento and honda city, I found Ciaz better than others in all aspects.
Areas of improvement The key could have been better.

Full Review 
Exterior: Though Some fin the exterioris to be average but in my opinion they are quite good. From all the angles the car looks great and has a big road presence. But looks are subjective.
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Feature wise this is the best car in its segment and they were a deal breaker while I was in the market looking for a car at this price band. It was between City and Ciaz for me but I choose Ciaz mainly because its interiors look better than City and also it offers more value for your money. Had City VX been 50k cheaper then it would have been tough to decide but at these prices, buying CIaz was a no brainer. Its bigger, has a better milage, better interiors and its features are at par with the CIty. Add to that all those practicle storage space and a smooth city and Highway rider. The Navigation system is top notch and so is the touch screen Display for Music system. Pairing with your phone is quite easy too and my iPhone connects as soon as the car starts.
Space is brilliant, both in the front and rear. You can easily sit 5 adults and that too with small suitcases with them. The rear legroom room is segment leading!
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox: Fuel economy for me so far is lurking around 14 and so far I have done 1600 kms. But I expect it to be around 16 after 2500 kms. Overtaking is easy on the highways and in the city I feel its just amazing to drive. The accelerator though could have been a bit more juicy based on the amount of input provided.
 
Ride Quality & Handling: Ride quality is good and you always feel in control while behind the wheels of this car.
 
Final Words: It is a great car and as the market situation stands currently its given quite a stiff competition to the segment leader-Honda City. Last month(Nov-15) sales(Honda City ~6300 and Ciaz ~5500) are a testimony to that(Verna ~1000 only). Maruti after sales service and easy maintenance add more fun to the ownership experience. 
Areas of improvement: None come to my mind, though if I have to say one then I would like to see a more dynamic accelerator and a smoother gearbox.

Exterior I just Love the way it looks on the Outside. The Elegant Brown Colour that i have looks Premium. There are other features like Projector Headlamps, Aerodynamic Body, 16 inch Alloy Wheels, Huge 510 Lts. Boot Space etc.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The Zxi + model is simply loaded with features like 7 inch AVN Screen for Audio, Video, Reverse Camera, Navigation & Smartphone Mirroring. Nice Biege Interiors, Roomy Cabin with acres of space, PU Leather Seats & Leather wrapped Steering with Audio Controls, Reverse Camera with Sensors, Auto Folding & Adjusting Side view Mirror, Start/Stop Button, Keyless Entry etc etc.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine feels great to Drive although slightly underpowered at 1348 CC, Fuel Economy is Good ( yet to get the exact figures), the Gear shift is really smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride Quality is Wonderful, Never found it underpower, Suspension takes care of the Bad roads and over all the Car is fun to drive.
Final Words I have paid Rs. 10.80 Lakhs On Road Mumbai and have found this car a Value for Money product from Maruti.
Areas of improvement Engine Power could have been 1.50 or 1.60 L as in the competition.

WORST  CAR  TO DRIVE  IN  THE  HEAVY  TRAFFIC  CONGESTION, YOUR LEFT LEG  WILL  GET  DAMAGE


Full Review 
Ciaz zxi+ just got test drive, claims hybrid, the moment you take your leg off from cluth engine is off, press clutch it is on, OK in long drive, once you reach top gear speed, you don't require to put back your leg on the cluth, coulkd smoothing driving for long but when you are in the heavy traffic congestion scenario, you are forced to keep the leg on the clutch which strains som much on your leg and knee, it may happen hundreds of on/off instances if you do not keep pressing the clutch, for stretch of just 1 KM drive. It is a worst thing to happen when you are forced to keep your leg on the clutch for the fear of engine getting off. The car seems bit over priced, the top end variant should hae been priced in the Rs.10L-11L, GPS not  provided, rear storage space is slope, things kept there will easily fall down, front seats seems to be bit small in size. Fuel efficiency can be seen only after we start using the car. There is enough dicky space. There are some positive side of the Ciaz car, but driving in the heavy congestion will be a night mare and tiring and ma case damage to your leg.

Final Words
 I am happy for choosing Maruthi Ciaz ZXI+. I had driven almost 8ooo kms from the Feb-2015 and newer felt bad at any point for opting Maruthi Ciaz petrol top variant.  i am getting 16.6 mileage in bangalore city. i use the car for daily commuting from ECity to Marthahalli.
Areas of improvement  
 Spare tyre is 15 inch disk wheel and not 16 inch alloy wheel for ZXI+ model. They can chanrge 5k more to the total price and would have given spare tyre similar to other tyres.

Exterior Size makes Ciaz a show stopper in traffic. Good bumper positioning absorbing small hits without damage to exterior.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Interior is the best part with Infotainment, space like an amphitheatre(pun intended but mataphorical), Excellent comfort for drive as well as for backseat.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Perfrmance is not great but good enough in Kerala roads. Afterall the speed limit here is 75-85Kmph.  After 1st service delivering a mileage of 16kmpl(Petrol) approx on average.
Gearbox has scope for improvement. Reverse goes dead at times.
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent ride quality absorbs bad roads effortlessly. Handling is good.
Final Words A great car from maruti. Barring certain cons which hope suzuki will improve in days to come, a must buy for those looking in the range of Rs 10 lakhs
After having driven swift, this presents a different picture altogether. While the swift was sporty and exciting, ciaz is comfortable for long drives and spacious at large. A real contender against Honda city and may be better for those buyers looking at Value for money. A real paisa vasool
Areas of improvement Gearbox, Performance.

Ride Quality & Handling This car have a better ride quality than much bigger cars like skoda octavia or audi under 30 lakhs as honda city is not even comparable and talking Hyundai is a shame in this department.
Final Words If you can fit a Navigation system in this car with reverse parking camera this car is way ahead in all departments under 15 lakhs this is the best petrol car in this country. AND ALSO THE TORQUE PRODUCED UNDER THE HOOD IS MORE THAN A DESIEL HONDAY CITY AND PICK UP IS ALSO MORE THAN ANY HONDA CAR IN THIS COUNRTY.
Areas of improvement REAR HEAD ROOM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR 6FT'S PERSON. I think in India we're lucky to buy a tjet motor under 11 lakhs I got this car in 10,20,550 emotion TJet in indore. you can also buy Maruti Caiz automatic in this range and honda petrol howevery the quality is good in ciaz not as good as linea but engine is the main USP OF THIS CAR.

Other than looks there is absolutely nothing in this car. Be extremely careful while buying such products. Sad interiors and sad material quality used. Post sales support is disastrous. No resale value and most importantly, Fiat India cares a damn for their customers. Very clearly Fiat looks like planning to wrap up operations from India. They are just dumping their product in Indian market as a final action plan. Don't buy. You'll always feel cheated. I would suggest each of my friends to stay away from Fiat India as buying this one can land you in some serious trouble and Fiat India will be least interested in your opinion. Customer care executives has no idea how to handle with dissatisfied customers and they will not even allow you to talk to any senior Fiat India personnel. It actually looks as if Fiat India is also fed up of the complains of Indian customers and feel it's not even needed. I am actually repenting buying this car in 2010. Within 75000 kms of driving there has been two instances of engine failure and after multiple mails written to Fiat India asking reasons of such frequent engine failures, no one has bothered calling. Can't get worse.

Final Words LET ME MAKE THIS REALLY SIMPLE : If you like to drive a sedan go with this car and if you like a driver to drive your vehicle go for Honda city.

DO NOT BUY NISSAN CARS  IN INDIA, YOU MAY BE CHEATED.
As I bought a Nissan SUNNY car through a GSA of HDFC Bank on 11th oct 2011 (Tuesday) and the Bank’s GSA Delivered this car at my home when I was not present. The Bank GSA came to my office and got all the papers signed by me. When I reached home and saw the SUNNY Car it was fitted with Nissan MICRA accessories as the MUDFLAPS and FOOTMATS etc. when tried to contact the Dealer m/s. MALWA MOTORS KARNAL the phone no. was given on Nissan website was FAKE and when tried to contact NISSAN Company the EMAIL ADDRESS of the Nissan India company is  FAKE.
And you do not even find any contact no. for the NISSAN company even worldwide websites. Anyhow when contacted the dealer m/s. MALWA MOTORS KARNAL, they say the company is giving the cars like this only.
Is it true that the Company could not complete the car and selling it in a hurry?and when called company’s customers care ( a call centre )  they promised to check the problem and promised to rectify the same in 72 hrs. but found no response as yet.
If the DEALER m/s. MALWA MOTORS KARNAL  is a cheater or the NISSAN COMPANY?
 but in any case it spoils the name of the NISSAN.

Full Review 
To start with, its an impressive car on the space and comfort front, with a great room for improvement in quality of interiors.. Was impressed with the rear seat comfort and hence had booked it!
I booked a Sunny XL petrol at Sky Nissan, Delhi. At the time of booking we were offered Free Insurance. However, a day before the delivery we were told that the scheme has been called off by the company and the dealer is helpless!! However we were assured that the Logistic charges of 7k would waived after a high court ruling in Delhi.
At the time of delivery (while we are at showroom), even the same was denied.
The only assistance we got from the dealership was on ease of cancellation!!
Nissan has a habit of manufacturing great VFM cars!! However, the problem exists on their choice of dealership & dealer network. A couple of my friends in US (who have used Nissan in past) have same experience.
Unfortunately, the company does not revert to any complaints on toll free number or over the e-mail.
This is a just a word of advise to all future buyers. Pls go ahead with your purchase if you are getting a great dealer experience. Else, ASS would be a big concern

This is to inform you that after considering many vehicles I finally decided to purchase Nissan Sunny-XL Petrol Model and I almost purchased the same on 27th August, 2012, but on that day I enquired from your another dealer M/s Sidheshwar Motors Private Limited, Ground Floor, Universal Trade Tower, Sohna Road, Gurgaon-122001, Haryana and at the initial discussions their sales person stated that they does not have Bronze Grey colour in their stock.   When I told him that I am going to buy the same from some other dealer then after some time this person called me stating that they are having Bronze Grey colour in their stock and also offered me a better discount and accordingly I transferred an amount of Rs.5.00 lakh to their account on 27th August, 2012 and told him that remaining amount I will give them by cash at the time of delivery on the same day in the evening.  I was shocked to receive a call from this dealership at about 03:30 PM stating that during pre-delivery inspection they have found vehicle damaged and they will not be in a position to deliver me the vehicle and I can choose some other colour available in their stock.  The dealer also stated that they have booked the colour with Nissan Motors and shall be available with them within a week’s time.  Since I transferred large amount, I have to do lot of follow up for getting my money back and I told them that the day they will receive the vehicle, I will transfer the funds to them again online. They were insisting again and again to raise invoice in the month of Aug-12, but I told them since they do not have vehicle with them how can they raise the invoice.
Now after waiting for around 15 days, I received a call from them that they have received the vehicle, but unfortunately they backed out from the rates they offered to me giving reasons that certain schemes have been withdrawn by Nissan.  How can these dealers make fool to the customers to achieve their sales targets – on the first instance if the dealer was not having stock – why he committed to me to give delivery and accepted full money. Also due to this I could not get the vehicle from other dealer.  In case it was a genuine issue, then he should honour the commitment and give me the vehicle on the agreed rates since the delay was because of them.
Anyway now I am happy that I have not purchased Nissan Vehicle since if the customers are being made cheated like this – what these dealers will do in future at the time of servicing / repairing of vehicle.  Now I have decided never to buy a Nissan Vehicle and shall advice accordingly to my friends about my experience with Nissan.

Full Review 
Exterior
Quite decently lined aerodynamics for all to see, so don't have much to say. Be careful about the bumpers as they are just stuck around withplastic clips. A slight bump and they might partially dislodge.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Good colour tone,comfy seats. Great music system, just connect yr iPod or any decent cell phone to the aux port and you will realise how good the speakers are. Excellent thigh support fr the front seats. If u are a higway type then u will thank Nissan all the more. Pint sized glove box is just good for car papers only, could have been better. No USB and Bluetooth is a big let down. Cup holders in the rear arm rest are just pressed in. Aircon isquite efficient and blower speeds are quite okay. Front and rear defoggers are also quite  good.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
Sunny XL Petrol I own is among the first ones in the state and till now have clocked about 4000 Kms. Gear shift is smooth and the engine is quite decent. Most comfortable in the range of 2500- 3000 revs. Have got an average economy of 18 kmpl on highway and about 14kmpl in the city but Lucknow is a congested place and since clutch is the most used pedal here so have no reason to complain. Both economies are with air con running and 5 guys on the highway and 3 in the city.
Ride Quality & Handling
Suspensions are light and avrg pot holes on the road are a non issue. Be careful on executing turns at speed above 60. Could detect a slight body roll at that speed. Less than that speed the things are a breeze on the turns. Steering is very light and sensitive and this is a bit of a draw back as u have to concentrate more at speeds above 90-100. For city driving it's comfortable. Front pillar are a bit forward located which creates a blind spot for the driver at an angle of aprox 45-50 degrees, which means that on crossings u some time have to crane yr head for the cross traffic, as simple eye movement will not do.
Final Words
All in all an extremely good package and worth every rupee of the 7.75 lacs u spend on getting this baby home. When I bought the car there were hardly any Sunny around. What  actually required getting used to was the people ogling you from the side then speeding up to see the front and falling back to see the rear . Lol? Yeah and one thing more which I read in one of the reviews here was about getting outfitted with Micra accessories. Ok very right bcos the Sunny accessories werenot in the market. Mine was supplied with Micra foot mats for the purpose of protecting the carpet, but they called up after 4 days came over to my place and changed the mats with the sunny ones without any charge.
Areas of improvement  
 not much. A bigger glove and USB n Bluetooth would make the complete package.

Exterior Everyones looking at you.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) My 6.2 feet friend fell in love with rear space even when the front seat was max backed...my baby could sleep even in the city drive peacefully.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Though not very powerful. Yet very responsive...its not a sport car. But for a family its just more than perfect. Gears a bit notchy but the ratio as claimed in reviews is definitely better than other cars i tried 
Drove it on highway for 250 kms entirely on 5th gear.coz at bumps it just glides without jerking. The odometer average was 22 km/l in city for 100 kms it was 14.5 km/l  should i believe it?? 
Ride Quality & Handling Just awesome, perfect better than fabi, vento, linea and manza.
Final Words Its really worth your money...and this price range u cant ask for more.
Areas of improvement Interiors, but then buy xv for 2.5 lack extra and u can get those..lol

Exterior Superb at dis price tag, teena inspired ext was good theme. Looks like a premium sedan.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Very good leg room. No more comments in anti about interiors, rear fan, seat fabrics. Ac  very intelligent design.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Not great n not bad at all. Decent performance. Overall acceptable one. Much oferdable.
Ride Quality & Handling Good handling. Need to improve in highways.
Final Word Good price tag for such a intelligent beast. Great job by nissan by getting sunny to india dat too at this price good one. Now this car will surely lead de market of entry sedans and also will capture premi hatchbacks market too.
Areas of improvement Service service, dealers. I m from anantapur ap I liked micra but lack of dealers n service I didn't get. I hope dey will get one near my place.
So many custmers like me are waiting in my place u can hav a servey in my place. n decide. plz make it fast r els my dad will settle to jazz.

Exterior The extrior of the car is mindblowing. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The interior looks more plush and beautiful than the older sunny.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox For a sedan of this class the fuel economy and performance is very much satisfying.
exterior, interior,. performance, comfort and space, boot space everything are awesome.
The Nissan Sunny blends modern design, excellent performance and stylish comfort to bring forward a one-of-a-kind experience that is truly magnetic. Thankfully, the driving experience lives up in every measure to the experience the styling promises.
Thanks to Intelligent Key and Push Button Start, the days of looking for your keys are history. With your keys in your pocket or bag, simply press the start button and the Sunny activates the engine and vehicle systems, so you can get right to enjoying the impressive array of convenience and entertainment features.
Ride Quality & Handling Great ride quality.
Final Words Over all its a value for maoney car. Great ride.
Areas of improvement Smoothness, Gear shifting.

Exterior: Good exterior & Interio of the car. Bronzy Grey is  a good colour option.Good interiors, no noice in the cabin, good A.C., more leg space, boot space 
 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Excellent. Big leg space  for rear seat. Good boot space ( 490 ltrs),  comfortable seats. Adjustable front seats. 
 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox : good
 . With A.C. it gave 15.5 Km per litre on Highway.
Ride Quality & Handling  Very smoth. Very smooth operation. 
 
Final Words
 A Good value for money. Good exterior & Interior. looks like a very high end car.
Areas of improvement  
 USB port for Sterio & Bluetooth are required. A slight / more ground clearance upto 175 mm( existing 150 mm ) will improve the performance in case of high road humps. Antenna for radio would have been kept on back instead on top.

Exterior The exterior looks and styling is exceptional especially in white colour. The front bumper, head lamps, grill and the back boot is got a unique rounded look. Stretched in size as compared to many sedans at this price point. I am enjoying the admiration of the car with its fresh in appeal and novelty factor owning a Nissan car in the city of Mumbai.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The colour scheme of the dash, fabric and other material is good and feels re-freshing. The space and comfort for passengers is simply outstanding. The fit and finish of the material used is nice. XL Petrol version has the is stuffed with features for the urban family needs.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Having completed around 1500 kms the performance of the petrol engine is nice; pick is smooth and currently I am getting mileage of around 12-13 km/ltr in city conditions. Though I think this shall improve to upwards of 15 km/ltr as the car completes 5000 kms with the first oil change.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride is comfortable in city and highways; though I havnt yet crossed the speed of 90kms/hr.
Final Word More than satisfied with the purchase and let me remind all its not just a car... its a CAAAR !
Areas of improvement Improve the size of tyre 14" to 15" thereby further augmenting ride quality. The gearbox needs some improvement, as feels notchy at times.

Exterior Ok. Poor quality of materials. WIND Sheild broke on it own in Bangalore weather.. NISSAN rejected the warranty claiming front bumber was changed before 1 month.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good. Spacious but very limited features. You dont even have the external temperature sensor. Very basic interiors. There is no big difference between the XL and XV version except for the alloy wheels, chrome finished handles and alloy wheels.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Average. Gets sudden acceleration.
Ride Quality & Handling OK. Good.
Final Words DONT Buy this CAAARRR. Terrible service network.. There were 46 CARs in queue to receive the front bumber to be shipped from Korea.
Dont Buy this CAAAAR. Pathetic service if you get any problem. It is not worth waiting for your CAAAR for more than 6 weeks to replace a front bumper. Finally ended up paying 50%. They changed the complete bonnet for the minor scratch as they dont have trained people.
Areas of improvement Change your dealer and service people.

Full Review 
Exterior Exteriors are nice, give a feeling of a big expensive sedan.  Happy with the car atleast for those who havent driven it
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good space but looks like that they have curtailed the bottom of the seat. I am used to keeping my mobile phones in front of me on the seat between the legs while driving and with this car they always keep falling. Infact its atleast 2 inches smaller compared to a dzire VXI or a Skoda Laura.
The car is too light and becomes bumpy on all pot holes, the shockers are also not too smooth (comparing with dzire best shockers even better than the laura).  Plus since its an overgrown car without much internal fittings it makes a lot of noise like hitting a large metal box which is all hollow.
The brakes - everytime i put a brake on speed above 50, everything on the rear side (including passengers) comes down.  The car feels to be too unstable while driving especially when braking and turning.  
The turning radius of the car is too large and you have to atleast take 2 turns. 
Gear - the first gear usually has a problem.  Also i think its gear ratio has been lowered to be driven at higher gears at a lower speed.  I usually do not come below 2nd gear even on almost '0' speeds and at a 80 kmph at 5th gear the rpm goes beyond 3.  So its more of a city drive (easy to drive in traffic) but not a highway car as beyond 80 it starts giving out a lot of noise.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel economy is good. 14-15 kmpl  in petrol is good.  Its low on maintenance.
Ride Quality & Handling Bad ride quality - see above
Final Words Not worth the money. I would rather spend a bit more and buy a Hyundai Verna / skoda rapid (rapid is again low on quality of plastics like sunny). so best car in this segment remains verna or a honda city or Sx4.

Exterior Stunning Exteriors ensure you get a glance or two every now and then,nothing to beat the style of this car in this category.. The curves are designed well on its Bigg Body and the car is aerodynamic. Paint work is of extremely superior quality.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Excellent interiors, spaaaacceee and comfortable ride. lots of Luggage space"Wsih i could be driven".
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I own a Petrol Version and sometimes fail to notice the engine is on at the Signals. City Traffic of bangalore the sunny is delivering 12 with on and off AC . on the highway about 15-16 with moderate speed of 90-100 km/hr.
Ride Quality & Handling Very Good Ride quality, Little road noise may be especially when the roads are not that good ,otherwise the engine behaves quite nice. This car is not a quick car but a very good cruiser.. If you want a sharp and fast car then you are looking for a wrong car.
Final Words Absoulutely Value for Money.
Areas of improvement Better Accostics beneath the tyres to reduce road noise, to suit indian driving conditions.

Exterior Stunning look, My white Nissan Sunny is simply good with night visibility and is a  safe car.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Space is good, but plastic quality is poor, amazing comfort but not sturdy or strong like volkswagen Vento. Good Asian car for the price paid. 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Good performance, sometimes smoky engine, 18 km in city with A/c. Gear shifting is at times hard and gets uncomfortable. Over-all ergonomics is done brilliantly.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is excellent on Highways, value for money and demonstrates the eastern wisdom of the Japanese car makers.
Final Words A decent budget car with good features and style. Needs to be little more sturdy. I have driven around 70,000 km and never felt tired. Reasonably good car for now improved south Indian roads.
Areas of improvement USB port to be provided, ground clearance. Increase more service centers an this car will surprise the Indian car market.  I have seen the singapore version of SUNNY and has a sunroof, wondering why this discrimination for indian consumers???!!!! But the singapore version of Nissan Sunny is relatively a small car.

Exterior Exterior of the caar is eye catching.the colour scheme availability is limited.the price variation of top end model xv and the middle model xl has a lot of difference whereas the extra feature available in the top end is the fog lamps only.no other major extra feature is being provided to you except for some cosmetic things.the car is really great when compared to its peer brands especially in the wake of modern and advanced feature which are being given to the customers in this price range.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good value for money esp. in Indian market where maruti ads like "kitna deti hai"This car is offering much better and advanced features in this price range. A great buy when compared to honda city/huandai verna etc when compared overall. the front airbags with automatic climate control and big vents for air ( on the rear also)are an added features.the trip meter showing the fuel avg.,the running capacity of thr caar with the remaining fuel and the fuel outcome of the marked trip are good features.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent engine performance with great mileage and comfortable maneourability of the caar.
Ride Quality & Handling Simply superb.

Ride Quality & Handling Very smooth ride, great grip on highway, very smooth steering 
Final Words Great value for money, one of the best car in the segment. this car is a blinder to buy, just go for it, its a world wide proven car since last 45 years. 
Areas of improvement Need to improve on dealership network. for after sales service. ichibaan has too much of load as compared to the no of cars sold, thus poor after sales service.

A good set of features like ABS, dual air-bags, Steering volume control, read seat A/C with control all at 7laks is a awesome deal.Nissan was cleaver by adding read-row conforts like more lead room, A/C wents with control on the rear and arm room. It is owners freindly car driver by drivers.I've had a Nissan vehicle in USA and it never had any big technical problems. Nissan Sunny shares the technology from Nissan Versha in US and so I assume the engine, transmission and all should be technically very advanced.Nissan is known for their poor marketing strategy even in the marketing capital USA. So I'm not worried about it. The only thing I'm worried is about their service. Honda and Toyota have established well and have good trained service people. VV don't give full control of to the Indian service station to maintain their reputation. Nissan is not good at both. Even in California after I bought my vehicle the servce station was closed and I had to drive a long distance for service even when I was living in a prime locality. I hope they establish good service in India.Overall I liked the car and booked it

Full Review 
Please excuse me for perturbing you to have written this message but I am crying to narrate my extreme grievances to Honda official as several mails and calls of mine have been thrown into oblivion by your Indian Counterpart. I am uptight and lugubrious to apprise you the following and strongly believe in your asymptotic ideas to ascertain the grievances. I appeal before you to spare few minutes off your busy schedule to have a bird's eye view.
1.       I booked a Honda city car at Delight Honda Delhi on 06/09/2015. On 12/09/2015, I was informed by one of my grieving friend (a customer of delight Honda) to stay away from this dealer by dint of his involvement in malpractices. The dealer has two showrooms at Faridabad and Delhi. The car is used as demo and test drive vehicle at Faridabad and sold at Delhi and vice versa. Hence, I mailed Delight Honda to cancel the booking, but the dealer feigned that the car had already reached so the cancellation was not possible.
 
2.       On 17/09/2015, I was invited for the delivery of the car and I along with my wife reached the showroom. At around 4:30 pm the delivery ceremony was performed and the car was delivered in dirty condition (smeared dashboard and muddy floor), albeit I had requested the dealer to provide me chance to inspect the vehicle before delivery but all in vain.
 
3.       I had seen the same car at their Faridabad showroom being used as test drive vehicle. I got the car with 56 km initial odometer reading. This means the car was used as test drive vehicle between 11/09/2015 (the day it reached delight Honda Faridabad) and 17/09/2015 (the day it was delivered to me). I had to accept the delivery because 17/09/2015 was an auspicious day (Ganesh Chaturthi)  and moreover entire money (Rs. 11.80 lacs) had reached the dealer.
 
4.       While driving the car at night near my residence, it's headlights went off all of a sudden and then glowed intermittently. The clutch, break and accelerator pedals emanated crackling noise while depressing. This proves that the car was roughly used prior to the delivery.
 
5.       On reporting the same to the dealer, the customer care manager Ms. Ranjeeta tried her level best to sarcastically prove me wrong which left me forlorn and insulted. I had to place the matter before the customer care (complaint no. 1-3310253049). Subsequently, I sent four mails and called eleven times at the customer care without response.
 
6.       On my pursuing the matter through phone,  I was informed by the customer care executive on 22/09/2015 that some Mr Gaurav Sharma of Honda India would visit the CHEAT DEALER DELIGHT HONDA on 23/09/2015 from 10000 hrs to 1600 hrs. to inspect my car and the complaint. I took leave from the university today and reached the dealer showroom at 1030 hrs along with my wife and inquired from the receptionist about Mr. Gaurav Sharma, but he was not there. In fact the receptionist told me that they had no information about his visit. I was asked to meet Mr. K P Singh of Honda India instead.  Mr. K P Sing exhibited his inability to intervene in this matter because according to him he was in - charge of the service department and not of the sales department, and my case was primarily related to sales.  It is the height of unprofessionalism and boorishness on part of Mr. Gaurav Sharma. Moreover, just ponder about his discourteousness and abjectness: if he didn't wish to visit Delight Honda by dint of some reasons he must have arranged to inform me, but he did not care to do that with the result that I and my wife had to wait there for three hours and I had to waste a leave from my work place. This shows the arrogance and dictatorial attitude of the representatives of the despicable Honda India as if the customers are beggars and exist on their mercy.
 
I request you to intervene into the matter so that I may not be put into further hardship.

Exterior Good.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good features, great space for 5
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The Petrol engine is noisy and sounds like a 5 year old car when you drive in 2nd , 3rd and 4th gear. The mileage is pathetic in manual transmission. Honda claims 17kml +, however in Mumbai city my car gives 7.5 - 8kml. During the 1st service at the service station I was told to drive for 2-3 thousand km to get better mileage. Have crossed 2k however no change. Very painful and unsatisfied experience. On expressway the mileage was 10.5kml. Honda promise on efficiency is a sham, like other manufacturers. Shameful as they do not have a solution. Regret I bought the Honda City.
Ride Quality & Handling The steering wheel is a bit heavy and hard unlike the old Honda City.
Final Words Do not buy the petrol version. Happy to speak on +91 9833XXXXXX.
Areas of improvement Deliver what you promise. Aggressive marketing may be a quick fix to achieve your sales targets however will not sustain in long run if the product is bad.

audio- no remote & poor steering controls, poor cabin light, only 1 remote key,  wrong mic placement


Full Review 
Five letdowns in my Honda City:


No remote Handset for audio System – You cannot control your audio system if you are driven by a chauffeur. Interestingly this was a part of Honda city earlier, but thanks to penury cost cutting the customers will have to live with this big handicap


Inadequate audio controls on the steering – No mute button on the steering, no button to switch on / off your stereo from the steering. The Bluetooth operating buttons on the steering are also not well placed and one touch last number redial is missing. Other competitors like Hyundai Verna score much better here.


Only one electronic key with the car – Honda City comes with one electronic and one mechanical key. The cheapest of the cars in the market (which come with central locking) would be put to shame by this level of cost cutting by Honda. The replacement of this lone key costs a bomb.


Poor cabin lighting –No map light above driver’s head (SV Variant). In other variants the middle cabin light is taken away in lieu of the map light still leaving the cabin poorly lit.


Mindless Designing – The Bluetooth mic of the SV variant is installed on the stereo panel (below the aircon vent) instead of the standard mounting on the roof above the drivers head (it is installed correctly in V / VX variants). This results in very poor mic performance and the person on the other end of the phone can never hear the driver clearly. A live demonstration was conducted in presence of Honda officials and the sound quality picked up by the mic of SV variant was extremely poor as compared to other variants (V/VX) of Honda City. After the matter was escalated to the President Honda India Mr. Kanayama, Honda customer care head Mr Rajneesh Raheja asked for two weeks to find a solution from the vendor’s end. However later I was shamelessly advised to choose from three options a) to move my mouth nearer to the mic while driving b) to reduce my aircon fan speed c) to buy an external Bluetooth mic from the market. There are other customer complaints regarding this which were also shared with Honda India. If any other Honda City (SV variant) customer wants to join the group of dissatisfied customers who wish to join the group in this struggle please contact on XXXXXXXX.

Am the owner of Honda city SVMT model 2014 For the utter shock it has been discovered that the front tyres have developed crack in the side and one of the tyre busted while parking the car on 26.03.2015.It is suspected that the substandard  quality tyres of" Good year Company" have been used which have caused this serious problem. The peninsular Honda Kochi, is not willing to replace the tyres free of cost and its just 9 months after which i have purchased this vehicle. Please dont use any good year tires if you do not want to compensate for safety of your life.i approached peninsular honda,kochi where they denied any replacement on warranty as they say it is due to the external hit.But it is not the mistake from my end or any driving careless ness.the good year company have not used proper tickness rubber to withstand the condition of the indian roads which is a huge mistake and everyone needs to refrain from taking the good year company tires.

Exterior Good exterior.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good interior.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Fuel:12km/liter-nothing different from earlier models.Engine vibrates more than earlier models.
Ride Quality & Handling Heavily compromised on sound insulations by replacing PU with blank space leaving behind air Which constantly vibrates ,making it very noisy on back seats.
Final Words This is no value for money car.I regret my decision this time although I have 2 earlier models of Honda city.
Areas of improvement It is cheap idea to remove PU foam.it has made car very noisy..Consider putting it back again in boot area,& other areas.Call back all current cars from market.

Exterior
Side groves help to looks bigger then outgoing design, thanks to 'H' design concept
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
Minimum machine maximum man, Honda proved it again, rear leg room is like sunny. Currently I am facing from lumber spine injury, however does not feel when I seat in side.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox.
Engine performance and fuel economy is at par with my earlier City CVT (Dolphin 2004), currently getting 10-11 (Thane to Bhoiwada,Parel) and 13-14 (Thane-BKC, thanks to SCLR) kmpl in city traffic, hoping to get more after couple of services and 18 plus on highways.
I have seen in many reviews, others are getting lower mileage, guess they are new to CVT technology. As I use to get 10 to 11 in city traffic and 18 on highways with my 10 yrs (1 lac km driven) old car.
Gear box doesn’t feel smooth like my earlier city. Hoping to become free after some days.
Ride Quality & Handling
Engine performance is very good, however little jerks when driving on 'Econ' mode with full load (5 persons), otherwise its ok. Not got an opportunity to go for long drive, hence could not drived in 'S' mode with paddle shift.
Final Words
Infect I was almost done about Verna and then Sunny in Dec-13, however just thought to look about new Honda city, which was launched on Jan-14 and then decided to wait till Apr for petrol. And now regrets, as wait was really worth.  
Being disabled person, got this car under 'Excise exemption for Physical Handicap person' scheme and saved almost 1.5 lac. Thanks to Mr Wallance of Hallmark Honda, Thane and Mr Amod and Mr Raju Ranjan of Honda Cars for their continues support and co-operation.  
Areas of improvement  
Nevigation system should have been placed in VX variant for this price bracket, as I cannot put after market Nav till warranty.

Stunning Looks.... Impress every one !!

Best Interiors.  Quality of interiors matches the Honda Class...
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
It gives 18 when driven on higways with full summer AC on and 21 when driven on highways with pleasant wheather and moderate AC use...  City Use with full AC, it gives 9-12, depends on the congestion, stopping and braking... It may be noted that I am using the top variant Automatic Petrol Car... VX CVT
Ride Quality & Handling
Ride quality is quite immpressive with good pickup even when driven on eco-on mode... Paddel 
Final Words
A Great Car with perfect Value for Money !!  Value for moeny in terms of Brand, quality, performace and re-sale value !!
Areas of improvement  
Options to program Central Locking should be given with more user friendly options...  All locks does open on the single attempt to unlock the car !! I would be great if two option be given 1) open driver door 2) other doors !!

Exterior
 Fabulous on the exteriors. Looks like a big value car. The tyres are quire small though
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 The hazard lights button is an eye sore and feels like it was put there as an after thought. The red color is also of poor quality.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Quite Good
Ride Quality & Handling
 Excellent.
Final Words
 The Honda Service offers 3 freee services. It states the first service should happen inside a months time, the 2nd service inside 3 months and the 3rd service inside 6 months. It makes me wonder is the car so bad that it needs to be serviced 3 times in 6 months? Looks like the free service is a farce else they would have put more realistic time frames for customers to actually benefit from the free service. Its a rip off.
Areas of improvement  
 The 3 free services all finish within the first 6 months of the car use. They should use some brains and put realistic time frames. Something like, the 1st service within 3 months. The second service within 9 months and the third service within 2 years of purchase. This is more suited ele i feel cheated by such a big brand.

Full Review 
Exterior Very sporty and stylish, except front bumper which is odd in lower part.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Great, very good trim and finish. Instrument console is at par with higher end cars. Dont miss anything really.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Excellent, smooth - almost zero lag during gear change unlike Nissan Sunny AT, Verna AT, Celerio AT, I10 Grande AT. Pick up is very good and the 120 Hp engine prooves its worth. Its trememdously silent unlike Honda's diesel engine which is a let down, like in Amaze.
Ride Quality & Handling Very good, though SX4 is unmatched in this segment which is also 100 Kgs more heavy.
Final Words I owe this feedback to all as I used user views before deciding on Honda City AT. And I dont regret it at all. AT is the future and now cost diffential is minimal for a very good CVT technology. If you are thinking this size of a car, just buy this blindly.
Areas of improvement Bumper, rubber parts, floor molding etc look light and flimsy. An AT option in V model would be a good idea as SV does not have basic features like fog lamps, CD player & rev parking sensor.

Exterior
 Good  looks but the build quality is horrible.The metal Starts rusting from all corners after few years as if Honda has provided the crap metal and coating.My Honda started rusting from doors, Boot, Under body, small points in Boonet.Really sad quality by Honda.My 5 years Linea has not even single point of rust.real trust Europeons on this quality.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Nice and roomy but long term the exterior will start eaing interiors.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Good and no doubt about it.This is only the saving grace for Honda.
Ride Quality & Handling
 Not bad but weak suspension
Final Words
 I dont think the car is only engine.There are several companies making world class engines and Honda is not only the greatest.Over the period of time I have realised that its good FE is at the cost of metal thickness and quality.I cant think of keeping a Honda for more than 3-4 years or face rusting horrors.
Areas of improvement  
 Honda has to work harder to improve the metal quality as seen in Europeon cars with sturddy rust free metal.

Full Review 
Exterior A very stylish looking car. Not much change in the front but exterior looks are too good. BMW like tailights, creases along the body give it a contemporary look.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The new city scores really well in this department. Ample space in the front and rear. Leather seats make things comfortable. Powerful AC and rear Ac vents cool cabin very easily. Only seat height seemed to be the issue. If seat cushion is high, your head might touch the roof, with seat down visibility isn't all that great.
Features are segment leading. Touch AC, infotainment screen, rear camera, sunroof, bluetooth telephony, rear AC vents, keyless entry. The list goes on and on. The top end is really well equipped and features are more than an even an Altis.
All these features really go a long way in delivering immense satisfaction.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine is the most powerful in class. Acceleration is terrific and overtaking is a breeze. Early to comment on fuel economy but driven sedately, it can easily give 12-13KMPL and 16 on highways. Petrol prices going down helps keep costs in check.
Gearbox is precise.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride is decent. Stability is good. The city cleared some big speedbreaker tests where even my brio tends to hit.
The one correction honda never made with the car is to upgrade the tyres. 175 section MRF tyres dont add to grip. Otherwise the car would have been quite an enthusiast's car. The tyre noise is also quite audible at speed.
Final Words The city is a terrific car to own. It has the looks and features and I would prefer this to even a D segment car like Altis/Elantra. For a budget of 10-11L, you just cant go wrong with this car.
Areas of improvement Tyres, Road Noise.

Expansive car but cheap compromised qulaity. Bought the petrol version of Honda City in Bangalore and my First new car earliers once were second hand and had no issues as many as facing with the new honda. Door Beedings are cheap starting falling down with in 3 days. With in 3 months Clutch plate had an issue and replaced. 
With in one year Right hand side wheel some noice coming in and Service center says this problem is only in Bangalore when the car is parked for some time say even one week and solution is spray high presure water or drive with noise for at least 3 - 4 Kms .. does not sounds crazy for Honda ?? Issue escalated to Honda no response. Shame on you!!!! Service guys are good at least respond but brand new card toaing to SC' s thrice in a year is hurting badly on the decision to buy this expansive card but cheap quality.
Bumpers are showing gaps on all sides, service centre says plastic after some time during any small impact means even speed brakers this gap would emerge .. does not sound illogical Honda !!!!
Just more than 12 months old and dont know what and all things to see in coming days. God save me and all the Honda owners.... have escalated directly to Honda and no response.

Exterior Good looking.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Features , space and comfort good
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Engine performance and and fuel economy is good. Gearbox is on the stiffer side, it is not so smooth.
Ride Quality & Handling Good.
Final Words I have used it for 8000kM over 18 months period. After 4000kM squeaking sound has started coming from the dash board and door. It is getting worse day by day. I am getting the same feeling as my 10 year old zen regarding squeaky noise and vibration noise from dashboard and door due to poor quality of plastics and materials. The plastics used is very thin and already the interlocks in dashboard have started breaking and this is casuing vibration of the parts used in dashboard. I am afraid to think what will happen after 15000kM. The feel good factor has evaporated.
The insulation used seems compromised, After long driving in mild summer the heat from engine enters the passenger cabin. It will get worse in summer.
The quality of knobs used is not good, it is okay. The previous models had better quality.
There is no nosie coming from the road into the cabin, unfortunately noises and squeaks are originating from the cabin itself.
Areas of improvement The plastics and other materials need drastic improvement. The insulation needs to be improved.

Must buy vehicle if u are looking a car below 13 lacs , has got all latest features for smooth & enjoyable ride.

I have purchased car in march 2013, in oct 2014 its right side appron where Soccer is connected got cracked, it was repaired by Araceli honda lucknow but again in just one month again it got cracked so badly that car was not in position to be used. i contacted customer care and they told me that i can go to Araceli honda lucknow they will do need full. as it was repaired by them. i handover my car to Araceli honda on 28th december but so for no responce now they are  telling me that will not repaire. Araceli Lucknow are cheater be care full with then are fully money minded, they do not care for customer. the person who handel my car last time told me that last time it was not in position to be used but i handed over car to you, they are tech person they know it is ok or not, if it is not ok then how they handed over car to me half repaired to kill somebody.
I say again Araceli honda Lucknow are Cheaters do not give your car for service or repaire to them. service is very poor, no body there to listen you. They just want money and money without doing anything.
Be carefull with them. Honda customer care is also useless, they can do nothing, only talking.

Exterior
 I got a Silver Petrol VX-CVT with top end features. Exterior design is very impressive. Alloys could have been a little better
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Leather seats are very comfortable. Needless to say that the car is spacious and plush. Door pockets on all doors is a good feature. The stock floor mats were not so great and probably needs to be replaced with better ones. The Dashboard gets dusty and dirty easily and is a finger print magnet.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 I would say its one of the best in class engines with excellent torque. The CVT is smooth and responds better than expected when the accelerator is floored. The fuel economy is ok as long as you remain in the green indicator zone, but in the start stop traffic of chennai from my home to office, the petrol is a real worry. I could squeeze out only 9kmpl in the first tank full. with a small petrol tank of 40L, i was back at the petrol station within 4 days.
The CVT has to be comended for the smooth ride and is a pleasure to drive in heavy traffic.
Ride Quality & Handling
 The ride quality was a bit of a let down. Probably due to the hard suspension and narrow tyres. Mine came with MRF ZVTV and transmits every bump and pothole to the passenger. But the advantage was a roll free high speed performance and is well planted in corners. i am worried that the hard suspension would lead to ratlling noises from the bad plastic inside after some time.
Final Words
 Overall the first 500km has been a pleasure but for the frequent fuel stops. My dad keeps comparing with the softer ride in the trials we had on Maruti Ciaz or his old Chevy Optra
Areas of improvement  
 Plastics need improvement, Music system to be better featured, tyres and suspension to be improved.
i also had a few issues of interior lights coming on and the boot opening on its own. have to see if they repeat.

Full Review 
Exterior
  Not a major change when compared with previous 3rd gen Honda city. Its just a facelift. However, the rear tailight looks elegant but should have come with LED tail lights & Turn Indicators
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Feature: Lot of add on's to the 4th Gen city when compared with prev Gen. Honda has learnt it from there close competitors in the likes of Hyundai Verna & Fiat Linea.
However, considering the price paid, the City Car lacks some of the Features which others competitors offer such as, DTRL's, Cool Glove Box, Telescopic Steering, Bigger Tyres, Remote for Audio System.
Space & Comfort: Interior space is good. Especially, the rear seat. However, the width should have been slight bigger by around 30mm which would have made more comfort to the rear seat passengers.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Honda's i-vtec is a gem of an engine. Its infact a proven engine. Its a Rev happy and more refined engine when compared to its competitors.
Fuel economy is almost good but not great. The mileage is around 11 to 12 in city driving conditions with AC
Gearbox is smooth and no jerks
Ride Quality & Handling
  Ride Quality is good and stable at normal speeds (until 110). However, at 130+ the handling is not that good. This is mainly because of Skinny tyres (175/65). One needs to upgrade to 195/65 or 205/65 to get more stability. Also, the kerb weight of the car is reduced when compared with prev gen city. The lower the weight, the vechile becomes unstable at higher speed. 
Suspension is good but it should have been slighlty better.
Final Words
 Honda City is a good buy but not the best. Considering the pros & cons which every car has, I can tell in one word as "GOOD".
If honda pays more attention to some of the cosmetic changes to interiors & exteriors along with bigger tyres and more Kerb weight (More Metal / Iron guage to the Charsis), it can way way ahead of other cars in the category and very tough to beat.  
Areas of improvement  
Areas of improvement  
  More bigger tyres (195/65 or 205/65), Better body charsis build quality, Handling at high speeds, width of the car to be increased by another 30mm.

Exterior Looks are great.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good, feel premium.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Best part is engine pick up and smothness, gear shift is smooth, feel the power of engine whenever i drive on highway, petrol engine is the best. Initially got a low mileage in city conditions but after driving on highway for 600km, mileage of car suddenly improved even in city traffic. Now, Iam getting a mileage of 12-13kmpl in NCR (city conditions) & got 17kmpl on delhi-chandigarh highway.  
Ride Quality & Handling Excellent ride quality, lovely to drive on curves, steering is light & easy to handle, i found it easy to drive in city conditions, doensn't hit the bad speedbreakers,  ground clearance is sufficient.
Final Words I am a happy man. My desicion to buy this lovely machine from honda was correct. Honda city is the king, ivtech is the best. Enjoying the ride!      
Areas of improvement Its only 1600km i have driven my car till date, coudn't find any shortcomings.

 The car has got a stylish look and i personally love my silver alabaster vx cvt with the alloys and sun roof, the bumpers are not so effective, i had 2 incidents wherein the impact on front bumper was very mild but still it came off and i found that the plastic is very weak as all the locks came off in one go. The tyres are bit undersized for this car
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) 
 The top end lacks several imp features like park assist, sat nav, dvd playback, glove box cooling, seat belt hight adjuster, otherwise the car gives a premium feel and the upholstery and dash looks amazing
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 best engine for this price, cvt makes driving very smooth and pleasurable, however fuel eco is bad, giving 8-9 km/L in delhi with ac and normal driving conditions
Ride Quality & Handling
 handling is good, no complaints, ride quality lack as the road can be felt in the cabin, even small potholes shakes you inside, 
Final Words
 With all the above pros and cons, i think its still the best in this range however honda should consider these little upgrades and tweeks

Full Review 
Areas of improvement AVN is a good option compared to vx but not thought of givng same way of operatioal ports as lower version instead of cables in dashboard which is full of wires. ipad pin is the older version and not giver latest small pin.
If you want to change the USB drive everytime you have to open the dash board. the storage space is sopiled because of wires ocupying it. 
Videos will not play in the avn and says watching while driving is against saftey standards. i dont think honda is the only company who thought driver watches the vedios and not thought of people who are sitting have to get bored and should stop the vehicle to watch the vedio. 
Overall Experience
Not satisfied with the extra price paid for the AVN should have given good finish if they should have thought of giving them as older version.

 I selected sail sedan LT ABS but when I went to show room they sales person didn’t show any interest in showing us their cars so we just left and went to ford where despite show room was closed they showed us the cars and ready to give test drive. We finalised for ford classic (Petrol in first week of Feb 2014 but waited for budget on 17th feb 2014 when prices were reduced by 15000 thousand. After some thought and working for all discounts I went for diesel for budget of 700000/- (LXI) . One day I saw New City 2014 and we checked the demo and all my family okeyed for this all new city . then I finalised for this model and finnaly booked in first week of march 2014. As the city has some waiting so we decided to get this on 2nd May but we got delivery on 6th may dues to transportation problem due to Lok sabha Elelction 2014.
 I drive the car on two day a week so not much driven (only 400 km till 24th June 2014. I just feel great while driving the car its excellent looking.
Exterior
 excellent, elegant, smart looks more like CIVIC
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 nice look 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 not able to judge running of engine , mileage good on highway but not in city , smooth drive - I checked on high for 17 km it gave average of 17.1 and I am sure that I can get 17.8 If proper on proper highway.
Ride Quality & Handling
 very good , smooth , till now only 400 km driven
Final Words
 look great and best value of money
Areas of improvement  
 Should have installed mud flaps in E version

Full Review 
Exterior The Vehicle was very well finished and it was pleasing to the eye. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The finishing was superb with ample space and leg roon both in the front and rear. The climate control does now work well- other than that the AC was very effective and there was no engine noise or vibrations in the interior.  Very comfortable in city roads.  However the leather seats were hard and uncomfortable for long/Highway driving 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The Engine is very smooth and noiseless. a Pleasure to drive with a very responsive acceleration even when the vehicle is new and is currently in the running in period.  The first 200 kms of running in the city retuned a mileage of 6.5 KM/Ltr of petrol.  The next 400 kms of Highway driving returned a Mileage of 15 KM/Ltr and the last 400 kms of Highway and (very small part) city driving returned a mileage of 10.5 km/Ltr.
Ride Quality & Handling Compared to the European cars, the ride quality and handling is not comparable. The European cars are much better.
Final Word The dealership (Sundaram Honda) needs massive lessons on Ethics.  Their Sales Rep speak in two different languages, Pre and Post sale.  They deliberately hide facts or make false promises and then renege on the same once the sale is made.  Very very dissapointed with both the service and sales.  Their Service Dept does not answer the phone and when questioned they unhesitatingly say that due to heavy work load we do not answer our Phones/Mobiles!!!
Service itself and is decent, unlike most other Brands
Areas of improvement Pre sale- their representative does not explain the features of the car well. Had not been told as to how. The boot could be opened without swithing off the engine. How the AC could be make to run colder. The operation of the Eco and the Sports mode etc
Overall experience with the dealership was very very dissapointing considering we paid much more for the vehicle when compared to the offer for the same vehicle from a different dealership, solely based on the reputation of Sundaram Motors.

Exterior - Looks are great!
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) - Very low quality plastic used everywhere, Dashboard, mirros and everythnig makes unwanted noises. Parts start falling apart even small impacts.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox - Very bad, Pick up in Auto version is very bad - seems like you are driving a scooter 
Ride Quality & Handling - Bad, as everything makes unwanted noises. it is as bad as old fiat, hearing noises everywhere, parts crumpling.
Final Words - will not receommend anyone to buy - worst car from Honda ever. They have compromised so much on the quality that this has become worse than a Tata car. I was a loyal Honda user (as had old city as well) but after this car will never buy Honda again.
Areas of improvement   - Almost everything, quality of parts is a big improvement area. Car cannot bear even small impacts and parts start falling apart. Offroading not at all possible. plastic quality needs serious relook.

I purchsed my Honda city IVTEC in Aoril 2015 and drove 3500 KM on both city and highway. The car is fantastic and fun to drive. Cabin is feature rich and comfortable. Steering is precise and braking is fantastic. I got maximum Avg of 17.5 KMPL when AC is switched off and 14 KMPL when AC i switched on. Drove the car in scortchin heat and AC took long time to cool the cabin. Car is specous and my familiy did not feel tired in 12 hrs jouerny. There are ceretain downside as it lacks the power at higher gears. it was difficult to overtake long trailers on a two lane highway. Specialy when it comes to tight situations. suspension could have been better as it does not absorbs potholes verywell. Though the dials are impressive, looking at information provided on them, it make sense to have the controll moved behind steering wheel to steering wheel. in case you want to check the distance to empty while driving you really need to reach for the stick which is hiding behind the steering wheel. I also have to reach to blow the horn unlike my previous car where honking was very easy. Honda should also consider seat cooling as leather seats tend to get very hot in summer. Overall cr is a great buy and I am enjoying every KM i drive.

Exterior
Looks are awesome automatic closes n open ovrm are in option compame gives manually electric foldable I like allowe wheels which give look to the car 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Features are awesome specially music system of the car bt in back there are less power of sound that's y I fitted company speckers also in back also. Without the extra speckers u can feel good bass and treble in front n u also feel 3D surround sound. There are lots of space in car n seats are very comfatable 
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
I have CVT version which is come with petrol only it gives 13-14 in city n 20-22 in hiway some times it gives 11 also when u stuck in traffic but it doesn't matter all around it is good in performance I give 5 stares becoz pickup of this car is very good im eco mode also. Gearbox are very good coz of CVT I can't feel of changing gears
Ride Quality & Handling
 Ride are smooth I don't feel rude road or obstacles in road bt some times car touches. Handling are very smooth I like its power steering also which is very smooth 
i read lots of review for this car bt I don't fell any smell or other problems from this car 
Areas of improvement

Full Review 
Honda Exteriors are good and as equalent to the product sold elsewhere in the world. However this is an area where cost cutting can be least as it would be of good visiility.
As for the Interior space in concerned it is also equivalent to the product sold elsewhere as there is a little compromise that can be made here. However the features been provided such as bending of back door seats to fit in more luggage and extendable head rest which is available in the same car sold else where , option of black fabric seats and lack sound proffing for petrol versions, neatly covered trunk are all missing and seems the company has taken quality for granted for the indian market of the reputation earned for earlier version. 
Fuel Economy though a matter of concern for Indian Market Honda should not have compromised engine performance for it especially when comes to mid size sedans where people who can afford these cars prefers most often to drive in long high ways or while traveling to different states. Most people would prefer to arrive sooner to their destination than driving slowly with best fuel economy. Gearbox offered by other car manufactures looks eligent when compared to the recent city and automatic versions which is becoming a popular trend are priced extremely high for Honda for fuel economy.
Ride Quality & Handling has not improved from previous version however in todays car market with the progress of technology this is debatable as many manufatures offers better stearing such as Electronic which is much smoother in long runs 
As for the final words Honda City is a good car however with more importance given on fuel economy over engine performance tripled cheap cost cutting and less importance to quality would it last longer ?
Areas of improvement: Quality needs to imporved, Cheap Cost Cutting for Indian makes is a concern as hatch backs these days have much better packaged interiors and trunk fully covered.
Simple rule of thumb, Mid Size Sedans are usually bought by different range of customers and so expectations are also higher to that of Hatchbacks currently in market.

Full Review 
Outstanding design by honda . much different and innovative from older versions. good built quality and fitting. backlights are mindblowing.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Good space and good interiors. however honda could have inproved the gates as it lacks in chrome and design as compared to other cars in the segment like ciaz and verna. the steering buttons are incorrectly placed making the use of horn difficult and the cruise button pressed unintendedly. gear shift is smooth but bit noisy. audio and bluetooth connectivity is excellent and responds quickly. honda could have given some additional features like GPS, reverse parking sensors etc. in place of cruise control which is useless in a city like delhi.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Powerful engine. fuel economy not up to the mark (10 kmpl in petrol in city), a pin drop silent engine even on rpm above 3, gear shift is little bit noisy but tolerable.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is excellent and steering is so smooth that you can turn it with a finger even when the car is at rest. however rear suspensions are not too good as they give a bump on small breakers.
Final Words Best car of the segment, buyers should not go at any other option.
Areas of improvement Fuel efficiency, suspensions, position of steering controls.

bought this great ride on 12th december. Already fell in love with first Honda of my life. Great handling, great mileage, great looks, awesome Aircon, Superb audio.

Exterior
Simply Superb. Backlight aesome design 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort)
 Great Airconditioner, cruise control, Audio quality.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox
 Simply zero detection gear shift in automatic, 13 in city and 18Plus on highway. More economical if cruise control is deployed. If driven between 80-100 KMPH, you are sure to get 18Plus milieage on highway. 
Ride Quality & Handling
 great ride quality, Steering is super smooth. Pickup triumphs in non eco mode. Simply amazing on signals. Driver doesnt feel the gear shift at all like in vento automatic.
Final Words
 Best in segment petrol automatic. Should go fro petrol automatic if the budget in 13 lacs. No deisel car is a substitute for Honda..
Areas of improvement  
 steering mounted controls have less functions. cannot select contacts from steering like hyundai. All features cannot be controlled from the steering wheel.

Exterior Sharp looks with good design. Attractive front grill and chrome handles. 
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) Features introduced in the new vento is quite good with the inclusion of cruise controll & mandatory airbags accross all variants.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox A very silent refined engine with amazing gear box which is the heart of the car. Good stabily at high speeds. Excellent controll of the vehicle on tight curves on the highway. 
Ride Quality & Handling Vento has really good pick up and superio handling at high speeds. Good Suspenions which makes the driving very pleasureful.
Final Words Vento is a car for the people who understand what drive quality is all about. I have been using VW Polo for past 5 year and there was no hesitation in opting for Vento. Other competitors cars in category were good but when it comes to drive quality Vento tops the list.
Areas of improvement Service stations.

I have booked the New Corolla Altis 1.8 JS colour Champagne mica Metallic  (Rs.13, 79,775/- on road price) with Rs.50, 000/- (By Cheque no.866501, PNB in the name of Cosmic Motors India Private Limited) advance on 1st, June, 2014 at Grace Toyota, Saket and they said you will get your vehicle after a month. On 9th June, 2014, I got the call from sales person Mr. Mohit Sharma that one car is coming in 7 days but that is a upper model New Corolla Altis 1.8 G Pearl white Metallic (Rs.15, 79,070/- on road price) which is 2 lacs above from the Model I booked and they somehow convinced me to take the upper model. They said you please get the loan approved from the bank and pay the balance amount before delivery. Then I paid them another Rs.4, 00, 000/- (By Cheque no.722391, PNB in the name of Cosmic Motors India Private Limited) on 16th, June, 2014 and Rs.1, 00, 000/- (By Cheque no.260874, PNB in the name of Cosmic Motors India Private Limited) on 12th, June, 2014. On 18th PNB bank has delivered the bank draft of Rs.9, 73,256/-.
After paying full amount they deliver the car on 18th, June, 2014, after few days I discovered that new car AC is not working properly and same has been informed to the Grace Toyota sale team Mr.Mohit Sharma, Mr. Furqaan and Mr.Ramit Kapoor (GM sales). They have taken it very lightly that this cannot be happened in the Toyota cars so they advised me to get it checked at car 1st service. Grace Toyota doesn’t have their own service station in South Delhi so they advise me to get it checked at Galaxy Toyoto workshop in Okhla. On 30th, June, I personally gone to the workshop and called the Mr.Mohit Sharma, Grace Toyota to have word with service attendant regarding AC problem to check the car AC. The AC technician just checked the AC with their hand that it happens in monsoon that AC get tripped when it get cooled, so they advised me to change the settings to lowest and keep the fan speed at four and it will run perfectly in this mode. Then I tried running AC at that mode it runs fine for few minutes and again it tripped and temperature goes up. Again I informed to Mr.Ramit Kapoor that AC is still not working, and then he sent their representative Mr.Davender Singh at our door step on 8th July, 2014. He checked the AC and found that there is some problem with AC and they said that there is a problem with the compressor and they might have to change the compressor. They said you please bring the car to our workshop which is situated in Gurgaon.
I shocked to hear that how they can deliver the new car whose AC is not working from the beginning despite of many quality checks at Toyota Manufacturing unit in Bangalore and dealer workshop in Gurgaon before delivery. How can anyone imagine a 16 lakh car whose AC compressor is not working from the beginning?
After knowing this I informed Mr.Ramit Chopra that how you can deliver the new car without being its AC tested and its compressor has manufacturing defect. After having this argument he requested me to get the car tested at their Gurgaon workshop. On 10th July, 2014 I went to their Gurgaon workshop for AC testing and they test the AC with some thermo device and came to know again that AC compressor is not working. After this I met their Manager and they said that they will replace the compressor and Ac will work. I said that how can you people not tested it before delivery of the vehicle, why should I suffer because of your negligence. How you have given it an OK certification if you people have not checked it properly. After this argument they have made me meet their Vice president Mr. Vinish Mittal and they called their team GM-CS Mr. Vikram Suri and Head Customer relation Ms. Dimple Tomar. They all tried to convince me to get the AC compressor changed but I insist why I should compromise with this due to Toyota Manufacturing defect. I requested them to replace my car with new one. They said they cannot decide on this and they will call the technical team from Toyota Kirloskar Motors head office in Bangalore, they will again re-inspect the vehicle and after their inspection they will decide what to do.
On 11th, July, 2014, I again visited their workshop at 11:00 AM and they kept me waiting for one and half hour. After one and half hour I persuaded them to check the vehicle. Their technical team from TKM (Toyota Kirloskar Motors) has started inspecting the vehicle with their computerised equipment. They start the process and it has taken them 45 minutes to diagnose that AC is not working efficiently and car compressor needs to be replaced. They all again tried to convince me to get the AC compressor replaced and I again insisted that you please change the vehicle why should I compromise in new car which has manufacturing defect from the beginning. They said our authority is to change the compressor rest will depend on higher official after they submit their report to head office. 
Then I made them to give me a report that its compressor is not working properly and it needs to be replaced. I again met their complete to replace the vehicle as it is a manufacturing defect from the beginning and they said they are only dealer and final decision is of Toyota Kirloskar Motors. We have sent your concern to the TKM and they will revert you on your email regarding their decision. So know I am waiting for their mail.

Poor Customer Relation department, writing severals mails but no response in writing till dat its been 36 days now.
  Today is 24th July, 2014, and for your information I have purchased this vehicle unfortunately on 18th June,2014. Its been 36 days since that I am calling you people, doing complaint on mails and met you people many times. I am the only who is suffering and harassed by you people from last 36 days.    Please let us know what is our fault, we have paid full amount without any discount for fully functional goods suppose to be delivered. Due to negligence of manufacturer and the dealer I have been delivered the car which is defective.   I hereby request to please take action against those who neglected this problem during pre-delivery inspection, why should we suffer and run after the dealer and manufacturer for this. Kindly reserves the rights of consumer by taking action against those who have committed this mistake and show this examples to your customers to gain further trust in Toyota Brand.   For your information I am the only earning member in my family, my mother has gone through two heart surgery, hip- bone transplant and has arthritis due to this she is not able to walk properly, my wife is pregnant and my 6 year son goes to primary school. We have only this car to commute which we are not able to use because its AC is not functioning. We belong to society where we believe in human value more that any thing. So please consider my plea on priory so that my family get total peace of mind by replacing this vehicle with the new one OR you refund my money back.   Thanks and Regards, Puneet Kumar Lall  New Delhi, India.

So the new Corolla Altis is a revamp, as claimed by the company but is it really so? read below.
I have owned the car for 2 months now, and put about 2800 Kms on it. It is the model 'G' and in Automatic transmission.
When I was in the market I was quite set at Skoda Octavia elegance AT. With its symmetrical lines and corners , its English look, the resemblance to a 2007 Audi A4 I was quite convinced it was the best choice in the segment . Well I was wrong. . My visit to Skoda showroom went unnoticed and I heard the horror service stories. So driving around after Chevy and Hyundai I landed at Toyota.
1) EXCELLENT SERVICE . The moment I stepped in I was attended. The day I bought my car and even on the day I put my car for first service. Free snacks , drinks and computers to do work with a TV telling me my car's service status.
2) LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. While I walked in with a mindset to see some taxis in the showroom, I walked out with a mindset to buy one. My first impressions of the car were on its interiors. Soft touch material all around, edgy door paneling and dash board, Comfortable seats, technologically loaded and NOT at all like a taxi.
3) HOW DOES IT DRIVE? When I first got the car, the BIGGEST concern was the rubberbanding effect on the Transmission. Speed up the car to 50 KMPH, take foot of the gas, put the foot back down and you feel the transmission bounce. But Now that the car has been driven and I no longer feel the effect. The Transmission otherwise is smooth, quick and well built.
Now I did see some complain about faulty A/C in the vehicle but I have had No issues what so ever. I do follow guidlines in the manual and turn off the A/C before I turn off my car but I guess some dont read the manual :P
Overall: My first car in India, and after driving in the US for a few years. I find the New Corolla Altis to be a serious driving pleasure.

Exterior New things are added in altis-
1. ORVM chrome garnish
2. rear bumper lower garnish
3. chrome side protective mould
4. back door garnish, chrome
WHICH I LIKE very much.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) There are some major changes in the interior as well, the dashboard is a beige and black sandwich with beige in the centre. it has multi information display that doesnt show too much as VW cars show but it is not a bad point. Below the head unit there is the climate controls and a 12V charging socket 
The rear passengers get a pull down armrest complete with an integrated twin cup holder.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox I am writing for GL which comes for mannual transmission it also has 7 speed CVT.
The corrola is powered by two familar engine options 1.4 D-4D diesel and 1.8 VVT petrol.  The petrol comes with 140 hp and 173 nm it is one of the great four cylinder engines of any era. there is no CVT at this price at this time so it is enjoyable to drive.
Ride Quality & Handling The altis is made for comfort rather than speed. the light steering is good for traffic and parking.
The petrol gives more enjoyment than diesel nothing gets translated into cabin external noise is kept external.
Final Words WELL I like this altis. this remains What it always has been- reliable, comfortable and a quality product that is affordable to run. The altis is the most important product for toyota india and they have given india what it wants. If you are looking for low maintainence car with lots of comfort then go to your nearest dealership and get your keys
Areas of improvement Improve the clock design  which is located at the centre. this type of clock design is taken from toyota QUALIS. I dont have problem with that but this clock has an old 90s design. this design do not suits in 2014 benchmark.

Exterior The new altis is indeed new from the outgoing model . The back is lexux like and gives it a very premium look. The front has very styish headlamps though some might now like the smile curvature of the bonnet. But overall its a very good looking car.Definitely and head turner.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) The car ahs very comfortable seats, the driver seat is 8 ay powered, the instrument panel is very well laid out. The touch screen offers sat nav, media options, the air conditioning is good, The rear is very comfortable and the best part is that the seats recline. The 7 inch screen is good but can be difficult to look at when its too bright . The rear camera is also good and gives you a track on the display.
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox The petrol automatic is absolutely wonderful to drive in the city, the acceleration is good, though I have not tested the 0-100. But it feels responsive as you step on the gas, The fuel economy is around 10-11 in city. The automatic gearbox is realy good and comfortable ,For those looking for some fun can use the paddle shifts.
Final Words The new altis has a very refreshing look , it is a featue rich car and you would definitely not be disappointed with it. 
Areas of improvement Positioning of the power windows  the door unlocking and window lock could have been better illuminated.

This is in regards to my car Skoda superb of which I used to claim am a proud owner of , as I used to love my car thinking I have owned a piece of luxury .To let you know, I am a self driving person and I love my car a lot ,Unfortunately, today the set back I received from your company has made me feel that my love has turned into loved.
In the scorching heat while I was driving the car, I paid toll at the Bandra Worli sea link and my car stopped . It was not moving at all. I opened my dash board , took out the manual but nowhere was something like this mentioned.
I picked my cell and searched on google a helpline number or someone who would help me out. Someway or the other I managed to get the number of the service centre JMD Auto , Kandivali , where my car goes for servicing. After umpteen calls I was given a number +91 98-21-465331 , which was of a towing person who would tow my car , as they said that is the only option.The so called guy on this number, came after half an hour and in the mean time I managed to call a driver from the office. I sent my driver with him. But to my shock and astonishment , he stopped the car after a drive of 5kms saying I need to pay him money first or else he would not take the car.
As I had to rush to some other place urgently and I had left, I had to arrange the money on the highway which was taken by this towing can person.
I am shocked and in no state to say that I love the service or my car called Superb by Skoda . You come under the banner of Volkswagen which is supposed to be the best car of the world.
With the kind of treatment met out to me and the sudden shock given to me by the car - I would request you that I don't want such a car. I  sorry and indeed feel that I have gone wrong somewhere in my decision to purchase this car.
After having spoken to others I have come to know, that this car called Superb by Skoda has this technical fault.
If this is so, then I would request you to please stop selling such  cars which causes more of harassment to the owner rather than pride.
This has been the biggest shock to me and if your car had defect I would request you not to send my car back.
You are more then welcome to keep a defective piece with yourself . Your person literally blackmailed into taking 3,500 on the middle of the road and there was no person to get back to me on the car.
Requesting you to contact the concerned person and get the needful done at the earliest . While I write this , today is the 3rd day and no one has contacted me yet!!!

First ever rant! Having the worst ever experience with Skoda. If you are thinking of car to buy, dont buy a Skoda! Bought a superb a few months ago, and have been disappointed from day 1.  (i) Car arrives 5 months after scheduled delivery.  (ii) The ride quality is terrible and the insides make a noise over bumps - the quality is really quite bad (iii) The sun roof malfunctioned within the first fortnight - the insides and family got wet in the monsoons. (iv) But what is the ...worst is the response from the company. Five escalations and visits to the dealer/company within 5 months. After all this, they tell me "Roads in Mumbai need to be better, and your driver needs to drive slower!" rather than listening to what I am saying. 
Either my car has an issue or the Superb model - either way its not great! I am sure some people are happy with their Skoda's but if things go wrong, you are done for!

Full Review 
Exterior Understated styling, not the 'in-your-face' jarring appeal, very functional exterior features that don't come standard even with a Merc or a Beamer.  Not overly aerodynamic since you'll begin to feel the wind resistance drag over 200kmph.
Interior (Features, Space & Comfort) This is the best part of the car, you'll probably get similar interiors in cars over three times the price.  High quality leather seats, wide and comfortable, 4 axis electrically/ automatic adjustable seats (front), the rear has acres of room that tempt you to use a chauffer. You can feel the quality just sitting in one - truly superb!
Engine Performance, Fuel Economy and Gearbox Highly refined engine, throws out 160 HP of power, meshed with an awesome DSG gearbox (7 speed), you could outrun any street car in a flash.  Thanks to the dual clutch mechanism you barely notice the up-shifts.  Downshifts are mindblowing when you need more power to overtake/ outrun someone on the road.  Though this looks like a relaxed banker's car meant to be chauffered around, it can suddenly transform into a driver's car and drag race anyone around.
Word of advice, go for petrol. It's silky smooth and more powerful. Mileage in city is an awesome 10, and the highways on an average of 16 if driven well.  Moreover, you'll not have a care in the world for fuel economy once you are inside the lap of luxury it has to offer - truly Superb!
Moreover, petrol fuel costs almost the same as diesel. And it's expected to come down. All that you gain out of the difference in fuel cost is lost in advance with the difference in the models.
Ride Quality & Handling Ride quality is comparable with the 5 series or the E class, definitely miles ahead of their smaller siblings.  Automatic DSG gear box has the option of regular and sport modes, and a manual mode. Paddle shifters add to the fun while racing - all standard equipment.
The only down-side being slightly higher body roll around high speed corners (trust me you'll not care).  Not to worry, ESP comes standard and handy if you lose the corner anyway.
Final Words The total hardware package is value for money, no doubts on that. Comes with problems associated with any big car - mainly with the electronics since they are not very tuned for Indian conditions. Safety comes standard with 8 airbags, ESP, EBD, et all.  Each part is meticulously crafted to offer you a fulfilling package.
Subsequently bought a 3 series for the wife and later a C class for myself, can't help imagining if I was taken for a sucker for having paid a high premium for lesser comfort and features!  I still have the Superb, though.
I've driven it for over 70,000 km and 6 years now (2009 model), and puts a smile in my face everytime I get into the car.
Don't fall for catalog features list of other cars; they are available in a Nano too these days.
Areas of improvement The servicing of these beasts seem to be the greatest challenge if you are not technically sound to grossly figure identifying the trouble yourself. The service advisors/ technicians are not really qualified/ sound enough handling high-end cars since most Indian companies don't really focus on this aspect and invest in training of quality personnel.
There's also the perennial problem of corruption among mechanics of the 'authorized' service centres, coupled with lack of technical knowledge, make you feel miserable for your purchase.  But that should not turn you off, since this is a common problem with any big car in India today.
